       "   'content': 'Question: Gdańsk (, ; German: \"\" , ) is a Polish city on the Baltic coast. It is the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland\\'s principal seaport and is also the centre of the country\\'s fourth-largest metropolitan area. \\n\\nThe city lies on the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay (of the Baltic Sea), in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia, spa town of Sopot, and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (\"Trójmiasto\"), with a population approaching 1.4 million. Gdańsk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the Pomerania region of Northern Poland. \\n\\nGdańsk is the capital of Gdańsk Pomerania and the largest city of Kashubia. With its origins as a Polish stronghold erected in the 980s by Mieszko I of Poland, the city\\'s history is complex, with periods of Polish rule, periods of Prussian or German rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a \"free city\". Between the world wars, the Free City of Danzig was in a customs union with Poland and was located between German East Prussia and the so-called Polish Corridor. \\n\\nGdańsk lies at the mouth of the Motława River, connected to the Leniwka, a branch in the delta of the nearby Vistula River, which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gdańsk with the Polish capital, Warsaw. Together with the nearby port of Gdynia, Gdańsk is also an important industrial center. In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town, and in the 14th and 15th centuries a member of the Hanseatic League. 1. Which bay is Gdansk on?\\n2.

The shooting sparked days of violent protests in Ferguson as residents demanded his arrest. \\n\\nSeparate federal and local investigations are under way, and Wilson -- who has received death threats -- has disappeared from public view. \\n\\nGovernor orders drawdown of National Guard in Ferguson \\n\\nHere\\'s what is known about his whereabouts. \\n\\nWhere is he now? \\n\\nFew outside Wilson\\'s family and authorities know for sure. \\n\\nWilson owns a house in a modest neighborhood about 20 miles from Ferguson. He bought the house shortly after he was divorced last year, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \\n\\nBut several neighbors have told CNN that Wilson left home before his name was released last week. \\n\\nWhat are his neighbors saying about his whereabouts? \\n\\nNot much. Most have shunned reporters\\' requests for interviews, and some put signs in their yards shooing away journalists. \\n\\n\"We don\\'t know anything ... Pray for Peace,\" one read, according to the Post-Dispatch. \\n\\n\"We have 2 children. Do not knock!! No comment,\" another family wrote. \\n\\nAny trails on social media? \\n\\nThe newspaper reported that Wilson deactivated his social media accounts before his name went public. \\n\\nThe only social media presence for him now is from supporters, who have set up Facebook pages to support and raise money for him. \\n\\n1. unarmed black teen\\n2.

Then you put them through a neural net of your choice, which produces some representation for each image, a sequence of numbers like [0.123, 0.045, 0.334, ...]. The problem is, if your model is unfamiliar with cat and dog images, these representations will be quite random. At one time a cat and a dog picture could have very similar representations (their numbers would be close to each other), while at others two cat images may be represented far apart. In simple terms, the model wouldn\\'t be able to tell cats and dogs apart. This is where contrastive learning comes in.\\n\\nThe point of contrastive learning is to take pairs of samples (in this case images of cats and dogs), then train the model to \"pull\" representations of similar pairs (cat-cat or dog-dog) closer to each other and \"push\" representations of different pairs (cat-dog) apart. After doing this for a sufficient number of steps, your model will be able to produce unique, reliable representations for cats and dogs, in essence tell them apart.\\n\\nThis method is not limited to images, you can typically use it with any dataset that has similar and dissimilar data points.'},\n",

       "   'content': 'It has to do with a process called differentiation, which means finding a derivative: a function that tells us whether another function is going up or down at a given point. For example, the derivative of `f(x) = x` is `f\\'(x) = 1`, because it\\'s always going up at a 1:1 ratio. This can be done for a variety of functions; notably, if you know the derivatives of `f(x)` and `g(x)`, you can also get the derivative of `f(g(x))` using a formula called the chain rule. Neural networks happen to be made of differentiable functions, so we can take the derivative of parts or all of it.\\n\\nTo use this for \"pushing\" and \"pulling\", we\\'ll put two images through the neural network. Let\\'s say the images are of a cat and a dog, so we want to increase the distance between the two. We pick one neuron weight from the network and make it a variable `x`, then construct a function that calculates the output of the network based on it and all the other parameters; let\\'s call it `N(x)`. The distance between the cat and dog outputs would be `f(x) = N(cat) - N(dog)`. (Of course, the real output would have more than 1 dimension, but we\\'re simplifying.) We now want to nudge the weight such that it moves the two outputs slightly further apart. For that, we can simply take the derivative! If `f\\'(x)` is positive, that means that increasing the weight will move them further apart, so we should do that. If it\\'s negative, then it\\'ll move them closer, so we\\'ll want to slightly decrease the weight instead. Apply this to all the neurons enough times and your network will soon converge to a pretty good cat-dog separator!'}]}"

       "'user: Question: Gdańsk (, ; German: \"\" , ) is a Polish city on the Baltic coast. It is the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland\\'s principal seaport and is also the centre of the country\\'s fourth-largest metropolitan area. \\n\\nThe city lies on the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay (of the Baltic Sea), in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia, spa town of Sopot, and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (\"Trójmiasto\"), with a population approaching 1.4 million. Gdańsk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the Pomerania region of Northern Poland. \\n\\nGdańsk is the capital of Gdańsk Pomerania and the largest city of Kashubia. With its origins as a Polish stronghold erected in the 980s by Mieszko I of Poland, the city\\'s history is complex, with periods of Polish rule, periods of Prussian or German rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a \"free city\". Between the world wars, the Free City of Danzig was in a customs union with Poland and was located between German East Prussia and the so-called Polish Corridor. \\n\\nGdańsk lies at the mouth of the Motława River, connected to the Leniwka, a branch in the delta of the nearby Vistula River, which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gdańsk with the Polish capital, Warsaw. Together with the nearby port of Gdynia, Gdańsk is also an important industrial center. In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town, and in the 14th and 15th centuries a member of the Hanseatic League. 1. Which bay is Gdansk on?\\n2.

Most have shunned reporters\\' requests for interviews, and some put signs in their yards shooing away journalists. \\n\\n\"We don\\'t know anything ... Pray for Peace,\" one read, according to the Post-Dispatch. \\n\\n\"We have 2 children. Do not knock!! No comment,\" another family wrote. \\n\\nAny trails on social media? \\n\\nThe newspaper reported that Wilson deactivated his social media accounts before his name went public. \\n\\nThe only social media presence for him now is from supporters, who have set up Facebook pages to support and raise money for him. \\n\\n1. unarmed black teen\\n2.

Well, check out the top five moments from Sunday night\\'s 2013 Billboard Music Awards: \\n\\n1. Miguel lands on a fan \\n\\nThe R & B singer accidentally landed on a woman in the mosh pit during a performance of his hit song \"Adorn.\" He was attempting a jump that went wrong. The fan appeared to be fine and the singer kept singing. Miguel later tweeted: \"got caught up in the moment, thank goodness Khyati is okay.\" \\n\\n2. Taylor Swift wins eight out of the 11 awards she was up for \\n\\nSwift is no stranger to taking to the stage to accept accolades, and on Sunday night she collected a few, including Billboard Artist of the Year. \\n\\n\"My album is kind of on the ends of the intense emotional spectrum,\" Swift said while accepting that award. \"You (fans) are the longest and best relationship I have ever had.\" \\n\\nShe also won Top Country Artist,Top Billboard 200 Artist, Top Female Artist, and Top Digital Songs Artist -- the last one a tie with singer Carly Rae Jepsen. Swift\\'s album \"Red\" won in the Top Billboard 200 and Country Album categories and her single \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" collected the trophy for Top Country Song. \\n\\n3.

It is the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland\\'s principal seaport and is also the centre of the country\\'s fourth-largest metropolitan area. \\n\\nThe city lies on the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay (of the Baltic Sea), in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia, spa town of Sopot, and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (\"Trójmiasto\"), with a population approaching 1.4 million. Gdańsk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the Pomerania region of Northern Poland. \\n\\nGdańsk is the capital of Gdańsk Pomerania and the largest city of Kashubia. With its origins as a Polish stronghold erected in the 980s by Mieszko I of Poland, the city\\'s history is complex, with periods of Polish rule, periods of Prussian or German rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a \"free city\". Between the world wars, the Free City of Danzig was in a customs union with Poland and was located between German East Prussia and the so-called Polish Corridor. \\n\\nGdańsk lies at the mouth of the Motława River, connected to the Leniwka, a branch in the delta of the nearby Vistula River, which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gdańsk with the Polish capital, Warsaw. Together with the nearby port of Gdynia, Gdańsk is also an important industrial center. In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town, and in the 14th and 15th centuries a member of the Hanseatic League. 1. Which bay is Gdansk on?\\n2.

Pray for Peace,\" one read, according to the Post-Dispatch. \\n\\n\"We have 2 children. Do not knock!! No comment,\" another family wrote. \\n\\nAny trails on social media? \\n\\nThe newspaper reported that Wilson deactivated his social media accounts before his name went public. \\n\\nThe only social media presence for him now is from supporters, who have set up Facebook pages to support and raise money for him. \\n\\n1. unarmed black teen\\n2.

The star is not short of honours - his 2012 Oscar win for Lincoln made him the first man to win three best actor statuettes. He said: \\'I\\'m entirely amazed and utterly delighted in equal measure.\\' Scroll down for video. Accolade: Three-time Oscar winner Daniel Day Lewis is to receive a knighthood. Day-Lewis, the son of former poet laureate Cecil Day-Lewis and actress Jill Balcon, has been nominated five times for the best actor Oscar and has a reputation for taking his method acting very seriously. He is said to have lived in a tent on a deserted Texan oil field during the making of There Will Be Blood. To play Guildford Four member Gerry Conlon in the film In The Name Of The Father, he spent two days in a prison cell without food and water. While shooting The Ballad Of Jack And Rose, he chose to live apart from his wife Rebecca Miller and their two children - because she was the director and he was playing a conflicted family man. And he chose to stay in character as fearsome Bill \\'The Butcher\\' Cutting even when the cameras stopped rolling on the Martin Scorsese epic Gangs Of New York. Star: The actor, who grew up in south London, won the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lincoln, pictured. Award: He also won Best Actor for portraying Christy Brown in My Left Foot, pictured. \\'He\\'d be sharpening his knives at lunchtime just like you\\'d expect Bill the Butcher to do. He\\'s just really intense,\\' recalled co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. But he is also not afraid to poke fun at himself. Accepting his best actor Bafta for Lincoln, he told the audience: \\'Just on the chance I might one day have to speak on an evening such as this I\\'ve actually stayed in character as myself for the last 55 years and had a various selection of Bafta sets downscaled, dating from the late fifties, placed in every single room of every house I\\'ve ever lived in and every time I rise from a chair it spontaneously unleashes a soundtrack of thunderous applause, with a few boos and some drunken hecklers.\\' Away from Hollywood, stories of his eccentricities abound. In 1997, he turned his back on the film industry and became a shoemaker in Florence, where he remained until Scorsese lured him back into films. Method actor: Day-Lewis is known for taking his roles very seriously - and for his role as Bill the Butcher in The Gangs of New York, pictured, he would sharpen his knives at lunchtime. The 55-year-old, who grew up in south London and has dual British and Irish citizenship, is fiercely private and lives in Co Wicklow, Ireland, with Miller - daughter of playwright Arthur Miller - and their sons. He also has a son from a previous relationship with French actress Isabelle Adjani. He is often spoken of as a recluse but has told an interviewer he needs peace and quiet to prepare for acting jobs. \\'I couldn\\'t work or get ready for a piece of work from a city base, from city life. I need deep, deep quiet and a landscape too that I can be absorbed into. \\'So much of the work is in the process of aimless rumination in which things may or may not take seed,\\' he explained. His breakthrough role was in 1985 British drama My Beautiful Laundrette and other acclaimed performances include The Last Of The Mohicans, The Age Of Innocence and A Room With A View.\\nout: Daniel Day-Lewis, who has won three Oscars, to receive a knighthood.

PUBLISHED:. 14:38 EST, 13 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 15:36 EST, 13 November 2013. Famed Raiders tight end turned television sports broadcaster Todd Christensen died at 57 in a Utah hospital on Wednesday after suffering complications during a liver transplant. The two-time Super Bowl champ\\'s death was announced this morning by Christensen\\'s alma mater, the school that would launch his impressive football career, Brigham Young University. Liver disease was among a number of illnesses Christensen reportedly battled prior to his death. RIP: Famed Raiders tight end Todd Christensen died Wednesday at the age of 57 after suffering complications during surgery. Christensen\\'s son, Toby Christensen, said his father died Wednesday morning at Intermountain Medical Center near his home in Alpine, Utah. \\'I\\'ve been receiving hundreds of texts, Facebook postings and emails — from everybody with a story about my dad,\\' Toby Christensen said. Christensen was a devout Mormon who didn\\'t drink, and his family believes his liver problems started 25 years ago after a \"botched\" gall bladder operation, his son told The Associated Press. Chosen in the second round of the 1978 NFL draft, Christensen was first a Dallas Cowboy. He began the 1979 season with the New York Giants but midway through the season he\\'d join the team that made him a star. The Oregon raised Pennsylvania native helped lead the Raiders to Super Bowl victory twice, once in 1981 and again in 1984. Christensen, at 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, never fit the Raiders\\' untamed mold. He was a thoughtful son of a professor, and even read his own poetry at a Super Bowl press conference. He later self-published three books of poetry. In 1983, he set a tight end single season record when he caught 92 receptions. Three years later, he broke his own record by catching 95. Legend: The 57-year-old (seen at left in 2002 and at right in 1987) was a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Raiders and appeared in the Pro Bowl on five occasions during his 11 year NFL career. Gladiator: In addition to his football career and stints in sports broadcasting, Christensen (center at left) was even briefly a host of the over-the-top American Gladiators television show. \\'Our condolences, thoughts, and prayers go out to the family of Todd Christensen. Great player, great guy,\\' tweeted BYU Football. As a college baller, Christensen led the BYU Cougars in receiving three times between 1974 and 1977, ending his career at the school with 152 receptions. \\'He had great skill,\\' BYU football Hall of Fame coach LaVell Edwards told the Daily Herald of Provo, Utah. \\'He ran the ball well and he caught the ball extremely well. He had excellent ability in all areas and those are the things that stand out.\\' In addition to his Super Bowl rings, Christensen played in the Pro Bowl for five of his 11 NFL seasons. After his departure from pro football in 1988, Christensen\\'s resume took some unexpected turns. He had a brief flirtation with Major League Baseball when he hit a home run during a workout with the Oakland A\\'s in 1990. He even briefly appeared as a host of the over-the-top American Gladiators television series. Christensen appeared in other television projects like Married with Children and acted as a sports analyst for both ESPN and NBC. Record setting: Seen here mid-game in 1985, Christensen\\'s career saw him break the single season reception record twice. He caught 92 receptions in 1983. Three years later, he caught 95.\\nWhat are the important parts of this article?\\nImportant parts:'},\n",

The location is excellent, as it is near my office, and the interior d\\\\u00e9cor is clean, modest, and charming. The music seems to vary, but on today\\'s trip, it appeared to be a mix of oldies and jazzy easy listening. While I\\'ve never had to wait for a table to clear, seating can be limited during lunch hours. The service is friendly and quick and the menu offerings plentiful and interesting. Vegetarians will find a handful of options here, though it is likely you can request to omit meat from any sandwich or salad.   Carrying Boar\\'s Head ingredients is a plus, however the way their sandwiches are assembled and the ratio of ingredients used simply doesn\\'t work for me. Oftentimes, I find my sandwich has a bulge of deli meat in the center and much less (and sometimes none at all) toward the outer parts nearing the crust. It has been my experience that the wraps are not treated this way, though the only wrap I\\'ve tried (Mexi) lacked flavor and tasted processed.   I\\'ve eaten one salad at Dilly\\'s - the Greek - and, while it is tasty, I discovered a dead fly in it halfway through and haven\\'t ordered a salad there since.   As other reviewers have reported, the soups aren\\'t as piping hot as I\\'d like, though the variety and additional \"daily soup\" is appreciated.   The bread is deliciously soft, warm, flavorful, and large - ideal for accompanying a soup or salad. If you\\'re accustomed to filling up on a sandwich made with normal-sized slices, I suggest ordering a half sandwich so you can sample a side of soup, salad, or dessert as well. All sandwiches are served with a pickle spear.  The cookies and brownies get 4 stars on their own.  Today I gave Dilly\\'s another shot and ordered a new menu item, the Red Bird, on wheat. Personally, I\\'m not a fan. The Blazin\\' Buffalo, Dilly Bird, and Smokey Mountain boast far better flavor combinations, IMO. Also, my pickle spear had a hair on it.  Dilly\\'s is a bit pricier than its nearby competition (All whole sandwiches are $6.99), though a reasonable price if shared.  Overall, this is a higher quality sandwich shop than Subway, Blimpie, and the like. Unfortunately, the fly and hair experiences combined with the bread/meat ratio issue guarantee I will not return.\\n\\n\\ninput: Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\noutput: I\\'ve only been to this Starbucks location four or five times, but the times that I have gone haven\\'t been that great.

After 5 and a half minutes,I hung up.  Poor potential patient experience!  I am calling for help, not to have my time wasted.  As an individual who works 60 hours a week, I don't have time to sit on hold, especially when you are only taking appointment calls between 8:30am and 4:30pm.  If she had come back on the line to provide an update, it may have evoked a better response but when you are forced to call for an appointment and cannot make an appointment online, the staff needs to be more on top of their game.\"}]},\n",

Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles\\' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn\\'t having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better.

Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião\\'s untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal\\'s neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal\\'s inadvertent involvement in Spain\\'s ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \"legitimate target\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal\\'s empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal\\'s greatest misfortune struck on All Saint\\'s Day, 1 November 1755. \\n\\nDoes the response \"Francis drake was on it\" correctly answer the question \"Why was the Algarve considered a legitimate target when it was attacked by Francis Drake?\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput: no\\n\\n\\nInput: \"Femme\" is an apt description of the depiction of Madame White Snake and all her incarnations. It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \"Lust of the White Serpant\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \"disturbed and agitated\" by her \"ethereal beauty\". In \"Eternal Prisoner,\" Madame White Snake\\'s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine\\'s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\". \\n\\nDoes the response \"A sexually attractive prisoner\" correctly answer the question \"How is Madame White Snack characterized?\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput: no\\n\\n\\nInput: California lags far behind comparable states in funding legal services for the poor, a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal needs of the state\\'s poor and lowerincome residents are being addressed. That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don\\'t get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children. Half the nation\\'s increase in poverty in the 1990s, when the number of poor jumped 30 percent, occurred in California, and nearly 25 percent of the nation\\'s poverty increase occurred in Los Angeles County alone. Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages. The commission\\'s report, \"The Path to Equal Justice: A Five-Year Status Report on Access to Justice in California,\" examined how the legal needs of the state\\'s poor have changed in the last five years as well as both the shortcomings of the justice system and the improvements during that period. Despite increases in state funding to meet the legal needs of the poor, low interest rates (which have reduced the IOLTA fund), high unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains. \\n\\nDoes the response \"New York State\" correctly answer the question \"High unemployment and the present economic downturn have threatened any gains in which state?\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput:'},\n",

While the water is heating up, fill a large bowl with equal quantities of cold water and ice. When the water boils, place the tomatoes into the pot and boil them for about a minute, long enough to loosen and wrinkle the skins. Remove the tomatoes with a slotted spoon and plunge them into the ice water.  Leave the tomatoes in the cold water for 30 seconds to a minute. This will stop the cooking process immediately and cool the tomatoes. Blanching makes it easier to peel fruits and vegetables. Peel the skin off the tomatoes with your fingers. If you want, you can also squeeze the seeds out if you don’t want them in the sauce. Transfer eight of the tomatoes to a blender and puree them until smooth. With the remaining two tomatoes, chop them roughly into small chunks. Melt the oil and butter in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the onion, pepper, carrot, and garlic. Sauté for five to 10 minutes, until the onions turn translucent and begin to turn golden brown.  You can substitute any or all of the green pepper for red, yellow, or orange pepper. You can also add five to 10 chopped mushrooms to the sauce, a chopped zucchini, or a small head of broccoli, chopped. Pour in the tomato puree, the chopped tomatoes, all the herbs, the wine, and the two whole celery stalks. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium heat. The celery stalks don’t need to be chopped because you will remove them from the sauce before serving. When the sauce comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and place a lid on the pot. Simmer the sauce for about two hours, then add the tomato paste.  Stir in the tomato paste and continue simmering the sauce for another two hours. You don’t have to simmer the sauce for the full four hours, but cooking it for the full length of time will yield a thick, rich, and flavorful sauce. Cooking the sauce for one to two hours will result in a sauce that’s slightly runnier and not quite as rich. When the sauce has simmered for four hours or the desired amount of time, remove the celery stalks with a pair of tongs, and use a slotted spoon to remove the bay leaf. Serve the sauce hot with pasta, rice, or vegetables.\\n\\nWrite an article based on this \"Use an Apple TV. Set up AirPlay on the TV. Connect your iPod to the same wireless network.

       "    'content': 'Like emotions, assumptions create blind spots in your thinking. Lawyers seek evidence to prove every factual statement, and assume nothing is true without proof. You may have had experience with a young child who asked “why?” after everything you said. Although that can get annoying, it’s also part of thinking like a lawyer.  Lawyers refer to why a law was made as its ‘‘policy.’’ The policy behind a law can be used to argue that new facts or circumstances should also fall under the law. For example, suppose that in 1935, the city council enacted a law prohibiting vehicles in the public park. The law was enacted primarily for safety concerns, after a small child was hit by a car. In 2014, the city council was asked to consider whether the 1935 statute prohibited drones. Are drones vehicles? Would prohibiting drones advance the law’s policy? Why? If you’re asking those questions (and recognizing arguments that can be made on both sides), you’re thinking like a lawyer. Thinking like a lawyer also means not taking anything for granted. Understanding why something happened, or why a certain law was enacted, enables you to apply the same rationale to other fact patterns and reach a logical conclusion. Legal issues are seldom black and white. Life is too complex for legislators to account for every possibility when they write a law.  Ambiguities allow for flexibility, so laws don’t have to be rewritten every time a new scenario comes along. For example, the Constitution has been interpreted to relate to electronic surveillance, a technological advance the Framers couldn’t have imagined. Much of thinking like a lawyer involves being comfortable with nuances and gray areas. However, just because those gray areas exist doesn’t mean distinctions are meaningless.'}]},\n",

My husband ordered the sage chicken of waffles of course which was so good. I ordered off their special menu for the day which was the crab cake ceasar salad. The portions were huge and the staff was pleasant and prompt. The first time we went, we became instant fans and took our friends out to breakfast here when arrived into Vegas a few days later. We were so excited to bring them there but to our dismay, the line was so long and we saw several large parties of 8 get seated before our party of 4 even though they arrived after us. When we finally were seated, we were very honest and told our waiter that we only had 45 minutes left to order and get our food because we had a show to see at the MGM. We took a chance that he respond with an attitude given ours when we were finally seated but he remained so calm and understanding the whole time. It totally made up for the long wait. He took our orders, went straight to the kitchen and came out with our food about 15 minutes later (not bad seeing as how they make everything from scratch!). We made it to our show on time and with full tummies.\\n\\n\\nQ: positive\\n\\nA: These guys know their stuff.

I decided to take my mother here for a birthday lunch as we were going to see a movie at the nearby Colisee.  We started with the pan-fried calamari and the onions rings, both were very good - the calamari was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the rings were crispy not greasy. Both my mother and sister chose the Madison's burger for their main - the burgers were grey - way overcooked and very salty. They also had a house salad with some kind of a ginger dressing - it was ok.  I ordered the Oriental Chicken Salad - which was swimming in dressing and the chicken was also very salty. I couldn't bring myself to eat the greens. I know this is a chain but come on - not good enough.  One positive note was our waiter who was very charming and attentive. He even brought over a brownie with sparklers for my Mom, which was very sweet.  All in all meh. They should serve the dressing on the side, cut down on the salt and not squish the burgers when cooking them (as I suspect) rendering them dry.  I think I owe my Mom another lunch after that one!\\n\\n\\ninput: Write a positive yelp review (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\noutput: T.

I had the best gnocchi in the world there, but since their menu changes all the time, it's a crap shoot whether or not I'll ever have that again. I like it because since I'm so not into dressing up for dinner unless I have a super hot date, it's okay to go somewhat biz casual. The strawberry salad is good, and I can't even remember what I had for dessert, but whatever it was, it was delicious.

       "    'content': 'Problem: Background: King was born in Long Beach, California, into a conservative Methodist family, the daughter of Betty (nee Jerman), a housewife, and Bill Moffitt, a firefighter. Billie Jean\\'s family was athletic. Her mother excelled at swimming, her father played basketball, baseball and ran track. Her younger brother, Randy Moffitt, became a Major League Baseball pitcher, pitching for 12 years in the major leagues for the San Francisco Giants, Houston Astros, and Toronto Blue Jays.\\nContext: In 1982, King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at Wimbledon. In her third round match with Tanya Harford of South Africa, King was down 7-5, 5-4 (40-0) before saving three match points to win the second set 7-6(2) and then the third set 6-3. King said in her post-match press conference, \"I can\\'t recall the previous time I have been so close to defeat and won. When I was down 4-5 and love-40, I told myself, \\'You have been here 21 years, so use that experience and hang on.\\'\" In the fourth round, King upset sixth-seeded Australian Wendy Turnbull in straight sets. King then upset third-seeded Tracy Austin in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-4, 6-2 to become the oldest female semifinalist at Wimbledon since Dorothea Douglass Lambert Chambers in 1920. This was King\\'s first career victory over Austin after five defeats and reversed the result of their 1979 Wimbledon quarterfinal. King said in her post-match press conference, \"Today, I looked at the scoreboard when I was 2-0 in the third set and the \\'2\\' seemed to be getting bigger and bigger. In 1979, when I was up 2-0 at the same stage, I was tired and didn\\'t have anything left. But today I felt so much better and was great mentally.\" Two days later in the semifinals, which was King\\'s 250th career match at Wimbledon in singles, women\\'s doubles, and mixed doubles, the second-seeded Chris Evert defeated King on her fifth match point 7-6(4), 2-6, 6-3. King was down a set and 2-1 in the second set before winning five consecutive games to even the match. King explained that she actually lost the match in the first set by failing to convert break points at 15-40 in the second and fourth games.  She reached the semifinals in her final appearance at Wimbledon, losing to Andrea Jaeger 6-1, 6-1 after beating Kathy Jordan in the quarterfinals, seventh-seeded Wendy Turnbull in the fourth round, and Rosemary Casals, her longtime doubles partner, in the third round. Jaeger claims that she was highly motivated to defeat King because King had defeated Turnbull, a favorite of Jaeger\\'s, and because King refused a towel from an attendant just before her match with Jaeger, explaining, \"I\\'m not going to sweat in this match.\"  King became the oldest WTA player to win a singles tournament when she won the Edgbaston Cup grass court tournament in Birmingham at 39 years, 7 months and 23 days after a straight-sets victory in the final against Alycia Moulton. The final official singles match of King\\'s career was a second round loss to Catherine Tanvier at the 1983 Australian Open.\\nQuestion: Did she play at Wimbledon or any other well known events during these years?\\nAnswer: In 1982, King was 38 years old and the twelfth-seed at Wimbledon.\\nBackground: Daniel Irvin Rather, Jr.  was born on October 31, 1931, in Wharton County, Texas, the son of Daniel Irvin Rather, Sr., a ditch digger, and the former Byrl Veda Page. The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor\\'s degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian.\\nContext: On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush\\'s Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush\\'s former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times.  Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them.  On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \"Memogate\" and \"Rathergate.\"  Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign. Many believe Rather\\'s retirement was hastened by this incident. On September 20, 2007, Rather was interviewed on Larry King Live commenting \"Nobody has proved that they were fraudulent, much less a forgery. ... The truth of this story stands up to this day.\"\\nQuestion: Did Dan Rather do a story on the Killian documents?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

Many people, and some professions, profess to have this ability.\\nOPTIONS:\\n- But some five percent of our minds aren't equipped to interpret a dream. The key is to practice consciously recognizing the meaning.\\n- When exploring a dream, imagine that you're today and you tell yourself to start the day with the sun coming up.

Once you visit a doctor, ask about his contact with laser eye surgery.\\n- During the consultation, the ophthalmologist will ask you how much you would have to pay to have the surgery in your eye. As a result, you will be asked about any costs associated with the procedure.\\n- Before picking an eye doctor, do some research on ophthalmologists that do laser surgery in your area.

In these animals the septa enable the circular and longitudinal muscles to change the shape of individual segments, by making each segment a separate fluid-filled \"balloon\". However, the septa are often incomplete in annelids that are semi-sessile or that do not move by peristalsis or by movements of parapodia – for example some move by whipping movements of the body, some small marine species move by means of cilia (fine muscle-powered hairs) and some burrowers turn their pharynges (throats) inside out to penetrate the sea-floor and drag themselves into it.\\nWhat do not have throats?\\n---\\nAnswer: unanswerable\\n\\nQ: What is a question about this article?

They saw deviations from Orthodox Christianity as heresies that were essentially Jewish in spirit.

He ceased consulting his colleagues and made more and more of the decisions himself. Although Nasser repeatedly said that a war with Israel will start at a time of his, or Arab, choosing, on 1967 he started a bluffing game \"but a successful bluff means your opponent must not know which cards you are holding. In this case Nasser\\'s opponent could see his hand in the mirror and knew he was only holding a pair of deuces\" and Nasser knew that his army is not prepared yet. \"All of this was out of character...His tendencies in this regard may have been accentuated by diabetes...

These focussed on jnana (knowledge) driven aspects of the Vedic religion and the Upanishads. This included metaphysical concepts such as ātman and Brahman, and emphasized meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualism. The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient and medieval era Vedanta scholars. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub-commentaries.\\nWhat did the Vedanta school represent in Hindu philosophy?\\nA:'},\n",

Try doing something small that\\'s uplifting.   Smile. Smiling can boost your mood, and it may be contagious too. Keep a gratitude journal. Every evening, write down 3 good things that happened today, or that you\\'re thankful for. Do a random act of kindness for somebody. You will develop more confidence in yourself and be happier if you hang out with people who treat you well.  Remove toxic people from your life. These are people who treat you poorly or who dump all their problems on you without reciprocating in a supportive way. to others. Being kind to people, whether it\\'s your best friend or a stranger, is good for both you and them. Truly listen to other people, do random acts of kindness, and find ways to make other people smile. You\\'ll walk away feeling a little better. Take time to take care of yourself with grooming and dressing to look your best. Keep your clothes clean and wear clothes that you love. Donate or throw away ill-fitting or old clothing.  Keep a good posture, as it can improve your mood. Try to get outside in nature every day. If possible, spend 20 minutes or more outdoors. Nature has a calming and uplifting impact on people, and it can help raise your baseline mood. Do and make things. Doing and creating things feels good. It’s amazing to hold a finished product of something you created that never existed before! Enriching and feeding your mind builds on itself and you’ll find yourself interested in new things that spark intrinsic interest, as opposed to external interests of money or prestige.  Do something that you find rewarding in and of itself (as opposed to because of external rewards like money or praise). What do you find uplifting? (Make a list if you\\'d like.) Try to do at least one of these things every day. Thinking positive is nice, but it\\'s not practical 100% of the time, and that\\'s okay.

Sometimes, you just need to turn on some sad music, look out the window, and have a good cry. Let out your emotions. You may feel better afterwards. Don\\'t punish yourself for getting upset.

Surround yourself with positive people. Be kind Take care of your body. Get outdoors. Be creative. Look for activities that help you feel happier or more relaxed. Allow yourself not to be happy all the time.\\n\\nProblem: Article: People report that different emotions feel different subjectively. While the clearest distinction is that negative emotions feel very different than positive emotions, different negative emotions also feel different from each other. Embarrassment feels different than sadness, which feels different from fear. Anger is experienced when someone has wronged you in some way. It serves to dissuade them from doing so again in the future. Without an emotion like anger, people might repeatedly take advantage of you.   The experience of anger sometimes begins in the back between the shoulder blades and travels upward, along the back of the neck and around the sides of the jaws and head. When experiencing anger you may feel hot and flustered. If you notice sensations like tension, pain, and pressure in your back, neck, and jaws, you may be internalizing your anger. Disgust is a response toward repulsive stimuli, often things that can make us physically sick. It functions to protect us from things that could make us ill. It can also be experienced when we find things metaphorically gross - like certain moral violations.  Disgust is felt primarily in the stomach, chest, and head areas of the body. You may actually feel sick or nauseous and find yourself closing off your nasal passages and moving away from the revolting stimuli. Fear is experienced in response to dangerous threats like bears, heights, or guns. It helps us to avoid these things in the moment and to learn to avoid them in the future. Although fear is an evolved emotional response, many of the things we are afraid of are learned.  Fear is usually felt primarily in the top half of the body. However, when it involves a fear of heights, fear often involves sensation in the legs. When experiencing fear, your heart may beat faster, you may breathe quicker, your palms may feel sweaty and hot as part of your nervous system kicks into high gear. This response is the so called fight or flight response. Happiness is experienced in response to things that often have implications for surviving, thriving, and passing on one\\'s genes. Examples of things that make us happy include having sex, having children, succeeding in a valued goal, being praised by others, and being in a nice welcoming environment.  While happiness is perhaps one of those most easily recognizable or well-known emotions, is also one of the most difficult to define. It can involve feelings of warmth throughout the whole body, or it can involve a sense of feeling content, safe, or living the good life. Sadness is experienced in response to a loss that we care about. It is a very painful emotion, which may act to help us to avoid losses in the future or to appreciate what we have when we get something back (such as in the case of a romantic partner).  Sadness often begins in the chest and moves upward through the throat and up to the eyes where we see tears. You\\'ve probably heard the expression: \"She\\'s all choked up.\" Allowing yourself to cry fully can be a cleansing experience. Paying attention to the physical sensations in these areas and allowing the energy to move, helps us to grieve after a loss and empathize with others\\' suffering. Surprise is experienced when something is unexpected but not deemed to be a threat. It is an interesting emotion in that it is relatively neutral in valence compared to the other emotions, which are often felt as positive or negative. Surprise may function to help re-orient attention to novel unexpected things.  Surprise is felt primarily in the head and chest. It is experienced in response to the unexpected; it can feel like a bit of a jolt.\\nSummary:'},\n",

Seven months after the popular uprising that drove Mubarak from power, Egyptians are still pressing for a list of changes, including more transparent trials of former regime figures acused of corruption and a clear timetable for parliamentary elections.\\n\\nEgyptians have grown increasingly distrustful of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took control of the country when Mubarak was forced out on Feb. 11 after nearly three decades in power. The council, headed by Mubarak\\'s defense minister, Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi, has voiced its support for the revolution and those who called for democracy and justice.\\n\\nBut activists accuse it of remaining too close to Mubarak\\'s regime and practicing similarly repressive policies, including abusing detainees. The trials of thousands of civilians in military courts has also angered activists.\\n\\n\"In the beginning we were with the military because they claimed to be protectors of the revolution, but month after month nothing has changed,\" said doctor Ghada Nimr, one of those who gathered in Tahrir Square.\\n\\nOne banner in Cairo read, \"Egyptians, come out of your homes, Tantawi is Mubarak.\"\\n\\nOutside the Israeli Embassy, protesters for the second time in less than a month pulled down the Israeli flag from atop the 21-story building.\\n\\nEgyptian security forces did not intervene as crowds climbed up the embassy\\'s security wall, pummeling it with sledge hammers and tearing away large sections of the cement and metal barrier, which was recently put up to better protect the property from protests.\\n\\nSince Mubarak\\'s fall, calls have grown in Egypt for ending the historic 1979 peace treaty with Israel, a pact that has never had the support of ordinary Egyptians. Anger increased last month after Israeli forces responding to a cross-border militant attack mistakenly killed five Egyptian police officers near the border.\\n\\nProtesters marched to the embassy from Cairo\\'s Tahrir Square, where thousands more demonstrated against Egypt\\'s ruling generals. Demonstrators in Cairo also converged on the state TV building, a central courthouse and the Interior Ministry, a hated symbol of abuses by police and security forces under Mubarak. Protesters covered one of the ministry\\'s gates with graffiti and tore off parts of the large ministry seal.\\n\\nProtests also took place in Alexandria, Suez and several other cities. Twenty people were injured, including one in a coma, the Health Ministry said.\\n\\nAbout 850 people were killed in the early days of the Jan. 25-Feb. 11 uprising. Tantawi is scheduled to testify in Mubarak\\'s trial in closed sessions that begin Sunday. The 83-year-old Mubarak is on trial on charges of complicity in the deaths of protesters, a charge that could bring the death penalty.\\n\\nThe judge in the trial banned TV cameras from the courtroom during this week\\'s sessions, and starting Sunday the proceedings will be closed to the media and the public.\\n\\nThe lack of transparency in trials of members of Mubarak\\'s inner circle has angered many in Egypt.\\n\\n\"These are all practices of the old regime: repression and restriction on freedoms,\" said Cairo protester Khaled Abdel-Hamid.\\n\\nAli Mustafa Ali, who traveled from the northern Sinai peninsula to participate in Friday\\'s protest in Cairo, said he is most angered by the trials of thousands of civilians in military courts, many of them political activists facing years in jail.\\n\\nAli said the military must also show they are serious about a transition to civilian rule by announcing a clear schedule for parliamentary elections.\\n\\n\"The military council\\'s politics are not clear. It seems they are trying to stay in control and not hand over power to civilians,\" he said.\\n\\nThe council has not set an exact date for the elections, but they are expected to take place in October or November.\\n\\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, which has the ability to mobilize scores of protesters, did not take part in Friday\\'s protests. Spokesman Essam El-Arian said the group, which was outlawed under Mubarak, is in support of the military\\'s promises to hold elections sometime this year.\\n\\n\"These demands take time and can only be carried out by an elected government,\" said El-Arian.\\nWhat are the most important parts of this text?\\n\\nA: Hundreds of Egyptian protesters, some swinging hammers and others using their bare hands, tore down parts of a graffiti-covered security wall outside the Israeli Embassy in Cairo on Friday.\\n\\n\\nIN: Mariota, Jameis wow Jets, NFL with sterling combine\\nAfter weeks of talk, Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota finally were back on a football field Saturday.\\n\\nThe consensus top two quarterbacks in the draft went through all the drills at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, including the throwing drills, and they both impressed the teams looking on, including the quarterback-needy Jets.\\n\\nThe throwing portion of the combine is something top quarterbacks have avoided in recent years, but both Mariota and Winston looked good throwing the choreographed drills to unfamiliar wide receivers. They showed deep-ball accuracy and Winston’s throwing motion was tighter than the one he used in college.\\n\\nWinston, who played at Florida State, was under the microscope even more than Mariota after a report surfaced Friday that he had weakness in his throwing shoulder. But he showed no signs of it being a problem. Winston said Friday that his shoulder was “great.”\\n\\nDuring an interview with NFL Network after the drills, Winston looked comfortable alongside Mariota, who was more measured. Winston got off a few good lines. When told they were going to watch some video of their drills, Winston said, “Don’t put the images of me and Marcus running the 40.”\\n\\nMariota, the Heisman Trophy winner from Oregon, ran the 40-yard dash in a blistering 4.52 seconds — a time that was better than 10 wide receivers who ran Saturday. Winston’s quickest time was 4.97.\\n\\nWinston said he wished he had run a better time. For Mariota, he was upset with some of his passes.\\n\\n“I missed a couple of throws,” he said.\\n\\nMariota had a 36-inch vertical jump, while Winston, who is heavier than Mariota, had a 28½-inch vertical.\\n\\nThis week in Indianapolis was crucial for both players, but particularly Winston. Teams had the opportunity to grill him about the trouble he got into in college, which ranged from a rape allegation to a suspension for yelling an obscenity on campus.\\n\\n“It wasn’t tough at all,” he said of the interviews. “I was just being real.”\\n\\nMariota’s biggest question mark is how he will translate in an NFL system. The offense at Oregon did not huddle and he never had to call plays. Mariota said taking snaps from under center was “something I’ve been able to work on for the last month” and said it’s an ongoing process for him.\\n\\nSome experts at various points in the offseason have projected Mariota slipping to No. 6, where the Jets would have the option of taking him. Most mock drafts to date have projected Winston going first overall to the Buccaneers.\\n\\nNow the top two quarterbacks face another two months of probing and speculation before the NFL Draft on April 30.\\n\\nMariota said this week was an opportunity to “market yourself to the best of your ability.”\\n\\nBoth players did that this week and both figure to go at or near the top of the first round of the draft.\\nWhat is a short summary of the above article?\\n\\nOUT:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Article: The ordinary half-wave dipole is probably the most widely used antenna design. This consists of two 1⁄4-wavelength elements arranged end-to-end, and lying along essentially the same axis (or collinear), each feeding one side of a two-conductor transmission wire. The physical arrangement of the two elements places them 180 degrees out of phase, which means that at any given instant one of the elements is driving current into the transmission line while the other is pulling it out. The monopole antenna is essentially one half of the half-wave dipole, a single 1⁄4-wavelength element with the other side connected to ground or an equivalent ground plane (or counterpoise). Monopoles, which are one-half the size of a dipole, are common for long-wavelength radio signals where a dipole would be impractically large. Another common design is the folded dipole, which is essentially two dipoles placed side-by-side and connected at their ends to make a single one-wavelength antenna.\\n\\nQuestion: Elements in a half wave dipole and on an identical axis are said to be what?\\nAns: collinear\\n\\n\\nArticle: Krispy Kreme, an international chain of doughnut stores, was started in North Carolina; the company\\'s headquarters are in Winston-Salem.

In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled by a set of external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also be thought of as a cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it \"steps\"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.\\n\\nQuestion: How does a stepper motor differ from a synchronous motor?\\nAns:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Q: U.S. TO WARN 500,000 MEN ON DRAFT REGISTRATION\\n\\nWASHINGTON, June 6— The Selective Service System, having registered 7.5 million young men, will start a final effort Monday to persuade the 500,000 who have not signed up to do so before they face prosecution, according to officials of the system.\\n\\nSelective Service, the officials said, will begin sending letters to those who have failed to register. They will be urged to go to the nearest post office to sign up before their names are turned over to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.\\n\\nThe list of those who have not registered will be obtained by using a computer to compare the Social Security numbers of all young men required to register with the Social Security numbers of those who have registered, the officials said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Selective Service has compiled a tabulation of registration state by state. This first such tabulation shows that Montana has the best record of compliance with the registration law and that California has the worst. New York Registration Low\\n\\nNew York is among the states with a low compliance rate, while New Jersey and Connecticut rank in the middle. The national average of compliance among the four age groups of men required to register so far is 93 percent, according to the Selective Service.\\n\\nMore than 97 percent signed up in Montana. Only 83 percent did in California. New York has had 86 percent registration, New Jersey 92 percent and Connecticut 93 percent.\\n\\nUnder an executive order issued by President Carter and kept in force by President Reagan, young men born in the four years 1960 through 1963 were required to register. Those born in 1964 are required to register this year, within 30 days, before or after, of their 18th birthdays.\\n\\nAmong the year groups, 94 percent of those born in 1960 and 1961 have signed up while 93 percent of the young men born in 1962 have registered, Selective Service figures show. But only 89 percent of the 1963 group is registered.\\n\\nOfficials said that the relatively low figure for the 1963 group was due, in part, to uncertainties last year before President Reagan decided to retain registration. They said that figures for the 1964 group, who must register this year, were still being compiled.\\n\\nSo far, the Justice Department has not prosecuted anyone under the registration law. Selective Service has provided about 225 names of young men who have publicly resisted registration. A spokesman for the Justice Department said that prosecutions of some in that group would start late this month.\\n\\nOfficials at Selective Service said it would take until the end of July to get the final letters out, receive the replies and determine who had failed to register. Those names would then be sent to the Justice Department, they said.\\n\\nA spokesman for the Justice Department said that guidelines had been sent to United States Attorneys to assure that prosecutions were evenhanded and not selective. Groups opposed to registration have asserted that the Administration had plans to pick out resisters and make an example of them. The Justice Department has denied that.\\n\\nThe Justice Department spokesman said that the department had not increased its resources to handle prosecutions of the registration law. He said it would decide whom to prosecute on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nHe also said that listed violators would probably not be prosecuted if they signed up quickly. If convicted on the felony charge, a violator could be sentenced to up to five years in prison and fined up to $10,000. The law covers registration only. To resume conscription, the calling of registrants into service, the President must obtain legislation and funds from Congress.\\n\\nPresident Reagan has said he will not seek to renew the draft, which ended in 1973, during peacetime. As a candidate, Mr. Reagan also had said that he opposed peacetime registration but retained it after taking office.\\n\\nThe Pentagon\\'s latest defense policy papers show that Selective Service, if given the authority, would conscript 100,000 men, beginning with those 20 years old, within 30 days of a Presidential order to mobilize. Within 180 days, a total of 650,000 would be inducted.\\n\\nThe military plans also show that for the first time, the Reagan Administration would also draft men into the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force, although the Army would get the greater number by far.\\n\\nAltogether, for those born in the four years 1960 through 1963, Selective Service has registered 7,507,539 men. The Census Bureau says there are 8,085,480 young men eligible to register. According to the registration law, men in the armed forces, in the hospital or in prisons or other institutions need not register until they leave the service or institution.\\nWhat are the most important parts of this text?\\n\\nA: The Selective Service System, having registered 7.5 million young men, will start a final effort Monday to persuade the 500,000 who have not signed up to do so before they face prosecution, according to officials of the system.   Selective Service, the officials said, will begin sending letters to those who have failed to register. They will be urged to go to the nearest post office to sign up before their names are turned over to the Justice Department for possible prosecution.

Glaciers can be found in all latitudes except from 20° to 27° north and south of the equator where the presence of the descending limb of the Hadley circulation lowers precipitation so much that with high insolation snow lines reach above 6,500 m (21,330 ft).

Tampa Bay dominated the game, maintaining a time of possession of over 43 minutes with running back Earnest Graham rushing for 124 yards and one touchdown. Tampa Bay's defense held Arizona to only 23 yards rushing, and held them to 2 of 10 third down conversions. In the first quarter, Arizona quickly drove down the field, connecting on a 47-yard pass from Kurt Warner to Larry Fitzgerald. The drive stalled, however, and they settled for 43-yard Neil Rackers field goal. Tampa bay answered on the ensuing drive. On 3rd and 1, from the 42-yard line, Jeff Garcia fell, but avoided a sack, and scrambled for a first down. Two plays later he scored a 37-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway. On the first play of the second quarter, Tanard Jackson intercepted Warner's pass, and Arizona was penalized 15 yards for a facemask, setting up the Buccaneers on the Arizona 27-yard line. Tampa Bay suffered two false start penalties, and settled for a field goal and took a 10-3 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay took the second half kickoff and drove 64 yards in ten plays. The drive was capped off by a 2-yard touchdown run by Earnest Graham. Late in the third quarter, the Buccaneers started a 19-play, 86-yard drive, lasting nearly 9 minutes. At the 8-yard line, Garcia threw to Alex Smith but the pass was incomplete in the endzone. The drive came up empty when Matt Bryant missed a 26-yard field goal. Arizona quickly drove down the field and scored a touchdown by Edgerrin James, narrowing the margin to 17-10. With 2:43 remaining in the game, Tampa Bay punted to Arizona. Maurice Stovall de-cleated receiver Steve Breaston at the Arizona 16-yard line, preventing a return.

On the Seahawks' first offensive possession of the second half, Matt Hasselbeck fumbled the football in the end-zone with defensive tackle Jonathan Babineaux recovering for a Falcons' touchdown. Atlanta would later add to their lead with a 25-yard Bryant field goal as well as a Ryan 24-yard TD pass to Roddy White. Seattle's only score of the second half came from backup quarterback Charlie Whitehurst with a 1-yard TD rush followed by a successful 2-point conversion with a Whitehurst pass to Ben Obomanu.

       "    'content': 'Problem: A nanny who worked next door to actor Stephen Collins and Faye Grant in the late 1990s has come out to describe the couple\\'s \\'odd\\' behavior. A Massachusetts woman who worked as a nanny in New York in the 1990s, in the same building as accused child molester Stephen Collins, has come out to tell of his strange daily visits in pajamas and reading his \\'semi-pornographic novel\\'. The woman named Ilene called into Boston radio station \\xa0Mix 104.1 Wednesday morning, just after it was revealed that the \\xa0actor famous for his role on 7th Heaven had sexually abused at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13. Ilene says she worked as a nanny for a family who lived next door to Collins and his estranged wife Faye Grant, when they lived in a \\'beautiful\\' and \\'affluent\\' Upper East Side Building in the late 1990s. \\'He used to come over for breakfast every morning, and have breakfast next door with us. Not too sure why, but he would show up in his striped pajamas.\\' While Collins and his wife always seemed to be having problems, Ilene says they appeared to be loving and protective parents of their daughter Kate. \\'I knew things weren\\'t great between him and Faye... they were always in therapy and always threatening to leave each other. \\'But for their daughter - they were always there for her.\\' When she read about Collins taped confession, released by TMZ yesterday, Ilene found it \\'creepy\\' since she knew him as a father and family man. Scroll down for video. The nanny named Ilene, who now lives in Massachusetts, worked for a family who lived next to the Collins in this apartment building just a block from Central Park. \\'It was weird to me that he did that to other little girls as well and he was so close with his own daughter,\\' Ilene said. Ilene describes Collins and Grant as \\'very nice parents\\' but \\'very odd\\'. However, she says he never displayed any inappropriate behavior while she was around. \\'Your would never have known anything was going on,\\' she said. One thing that struck her as strange about Collins was the sexual nature of his two novels, which were quite a departure from the image he created playing Rev Eric Camden on 7th Heaven for more than a decade. Ilene says she was given the opportunity to read his book Eye Contact before it was published and she found the writing to be \\'semi pornographic\\'. I always thought it was weird that he wrote a pretty graphic novel. I thought that was a little odd because he didn\\'t seem like that type of person when you knew him, but when you read the book you were like \"wow this is pretty dirty,\"\\' she said. Collins has written two mystery-thriller novels, Eye Contact (left) and Double Exposure (right). Both appear to have a sexual nature, according to summaries online. Collins has penned two mystery-thriller novels, Eye Contact and Double Exposure. Eye Contact is about a New York actress \\'whose best performances are off-screen, in her dangerous relations with men\\' Meanwhile, Double Exposure brands itself as a novel about the private life of a TV critic who  has a \\'five-year-old daughter, an angry ex-wife, and a very-soon-to-be-ex-fiancie, not to mention a come-hither co-anchor, and a beautiful brand-new neighbor who\\'s alluring, available . . . and much, much more than meets the eye\\'. Collins is currently under investigation by the NYPD in response to tapes released yesterday, in which he confesses to exposing himself and even touching at least three girls between the ages of 10 and 13 in both New York and Los Angeles. The LAPD is collaborating with New York authorities, but they initially closed their own investigation into Collins two years ago after receiving the tapes themselves and finding \\'no verified victim\\'. Collins is best-known for his rule as the Rev Eric Camden on long-running family drama 7th Heaven. Pictured with the case above at the TV Guide Awards.\\n\\nWhat are highlight points?\\nAnswer: The former nanny named Ilene worked for a family who lived next door to Collins and his wife Faye Grant in the late 1990s. She described the couple as \\'odd\\' but seemingly good parents to their daughter Kate. Ilene was most surprised by the sexual nature of one of Collins mystery-thriller novels. The 67-year-old actor, best known for his role on 7th Heaven, is currently under investigation by the NYPD for claims of child molestation.\\nText: Stoke City forward Bojan Krkic faces up to six months on the sidelines after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury. Bojan scored a firecracker of a volley on Monday evening against Rochdale but then pulled up unchallenged while chasing the ball in the penalty area. The 24-year-old exited on crutches and has spent the past 24 hours in hospital.\\xa0He was informed of the news on Tuesday afternoon. Bojan Krkic receives treatment after falling awkwardly on his knee as he raced through on the Rochdale goal. Stoke forward Bojan is tended to by the club physio after appearing to injure his knee against Rochdale. As revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday afternoon, it is understood  it is an anterior cruciate ligament injury to the left knee and Bojan has been ruled out for the rest of the season. He will undergo surgery, either in Staffordshire or in his native Catalonia. The time-span of his absence is estimated to be between five and six months. Sources close to his family told\\xa0Sportsmail that Bojan was devastated and taken aback by the news on Tuesday afternoon after he had revitalised his career this season under Mark Hughes. Bojan, pictured celebrating after scoring the opener, is checked on by Marko Arnautovic after going down. Bojan celebrates the opening goal as Stoke took a firm grip on the FA Cup tie right from kick off. The player believes that he has been in the best form of the career and it feels a particularly wicked twist of fate after Bojan had finally discovered consistency in his performances and opportunities at a club. He had scored five goals in his last 10 games and has widely praised as one of the signings of the season. Stoke confirmed that Bojan will miss the remainder of the season on Tuesday evening. Manager Hughes said: \\'It\\'s bitterly disappointing for the club but even more so for Bojan himself as he was making such a big impact in the Premier League and clearly enjoying his football. We wish him a speedy recovery.\\'\\nHighlights:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department\\'s counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government\\'s legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President\\'s life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he\\'d help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\" The U.S. effort continued. \\n\\nQuestion: \"Who were the U.

Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \"in the service of justice,\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation\\'s legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \"low bono,\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it\\'s really brutal and you\\'re almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there\\'s a light at the end of the tunnel,\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \"But if our graduates don\\'t do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary\\'s Law School in Texas. (St. Mary\\'s later dropped out.) Since then, it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranks: the University of Michigan, Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools, New York Law School, University of New Mexico School of Law, Thomas M. Cooley Law School and Touro Law School. It has elicited at least initial interest from 19 more. \\n\\nQuestion: \"One partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse while the other handles what?\"\\n\\nAnswer: \"Hospital lab specimens\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\nAnswer: yes\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nOur sun and other stars release light energy.

This form of energy travels through space. Electromagnetic energy includes the light we see. It also includes much more. Many of these things we know about, but dont always think about. Electromagnetic energy includes radio waves, microwaves, and X rays. We now have devices in our homes and offices that release these same forms of energy.

Nothing could be smarter, not anything better calculated to disguise a man. Disguise, as any actor or detective can tell you, is not so much a matter of make- up as suggestion. It is little mannerisms--unstudied habits that identify. The suggestion that you are some one else is the thing to strive for, not the concealment of who you really are. Grim\\'s skin had been sun-tanned in the Arab campaign under Lawrence against the Turks. The Shereefian helmet is a compromise between the East and West, having a strip of cloth hanging down behind it as far as the shoulders and covering the ears on either side, to take the place of the Arab head-dress. The khaki uniform had just enough of Oriental touch about it to distinguish it from that of a British officer. No man inexperienced in disguise would dream of choosing it; for the simple reason that it would not seem to him disguise enough. Yet Grim now looked so exactly like somebody else that it was hard to believe he was the same man who had been in the room ten minutes before. His mimicry of the Syrian military walk--blended of pride and desire not to seem proud--was perfect. \\n\\nDoes the response \"The uniform of a Shereefian officer\" correctly answer the question \"What uniform did Grim use to disguise himself?\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: Write a positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) movie review.\\n\\nAnswer: This movie is another horror anthology. It is rather good, but it could have used a bit more. I compare it to \"Doctor Terror\\'s House of Horrors\", though in this one the title fits. It has four stories all somewhat connected by a house. The first tale is about a writer and his wife moving in. He creates a killer for his latest novel and then he starts seeing the killer roaming around in his house. This one is sort of predictable, but it does throw a few twists in the end. The next story is a bit more unpredictable, and you really do not know where the heck it is going. This one features Peter Cushing and was probably my favorite of the bunch. This guy buys the house, but it is not the house that takes center stage, but a rather strange wax museum. The third story starts out rather good and features Christopher Lee. This one has him as a rather bizarre dad who seems awfully protective of his daughter. The problem is that once you know what is going on the story does not end soon enough. It drags a bit leading to a very predictable conclusion. Then the final tale concerns an actor buying a cloak from an odd little shop. The actor really gets what he paid for. Then there is a small story about an officer who is seen throughout trying to find out what happened to this actor and then an explanation of why these things happened. Though I was not very satisfied with the explanation as I don\\'t think it really explained Cushing\\'s story much at all. I think they needed a bit more back story for that one. All in all though it was an interesting set of stories.\\n\\n\\nProblem: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive positive\\n=++++=\\nAnswer: A true story about a true revolution, 25 of April ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years, that was imposing a colonial war on it\\'s military\\'s, for maintaining an empire (Angola, Mozambique, Guine-Bissau, Cabo Verde, S. Tomé e Principe; the first and the last of the great colonial empire\\'s of Europe) of 600 years, since it\\'s beginning in the conquest of Ceuta in 1415; a revolution by the army for the people, and for a democratic Portugal; the most\\'s surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it (except those that died in the hand\\'s of PIDE, the political police of the State, during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it\\'s headquarters in the day of the revolution, in 25 of April 1974, has it show\\'s on the film).And has all revolutions it has it\\'s heroes, one them of was Captain Salgueiro Maia, a returned soldier from the war, whose convictions along with the rest of the army, was that they were fighting (since 1961) a hopeless war, and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it\\'s country.\\n\\n\\nAn example of a movie review. negative (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\n\\nA: Shiner, directed by Christian Calson, centers around three \"couples\" and their relationships with obsession and violence. Pretty good start as far as I\\'m concerned. Interesting. The couples break down into a heterosexual couple, two heterosexual male friends and a straight guy being \"harmlessly\" stalked by a gay man.\\n\\nThe \"het\" couple really don\\'t have much of a role in the film. There are some scenes that show how they like to be aggressive when having sex or playing around with each other, but seem to have no real purpose since the are so marginalized. My assumption is that they represent a more day to day illustration of how sex/violence are integrated in a couples life. The couple aren\\'t very aggressive and it\\'s not even shot in any kind of erotic way. As characters, they don\\'t add much to the theme or plot.\\n\\nThe two male friends make up the bulk of the plot. They engage in some gay bashing of sorts by convincing a homosexual man to have sex with them in an alley. This escalates into violence. And the violence changes them. It becomes a means of sexual gratification. And their need for violence t release grows as the film progresses. The main problem I had is the violence is not convincing. Never once does it seem that any of the characters is in any real danger. It just doesn\\'t work. Given that the whole theme of the film is about the characters\\' relationships with violence, this is a major problem. Unfortunately, the make-up doesn\\'t help either. Sometimes, it\\'s okay, other times it is very bad. In one scene, I really wondered why one of the characters had rouge smeared on his face. Confusing.\\n\\nThe more interesting pair of the characters is the \"stalker couple.\" Here Calson seemed to have more to say and was able to develop a more coherent storyline. Perhaps it is because the characters seem to develop more and have resolution at the end. Shiner may well have been much better if it had stuck with these two.\\n\\nI appreciate that Calson wanted to achieve a lot with this film. It is admirable. Most low budget flicks don\\'t aspire to much. I don\\'t think Calson achieved want he was aiming for. Myself, I found nothing particularly controversial or unsettling. Shiner was unconvincing. This doesn\\'t mean, however, that the director can\\'t achieve something with his next film.\\n\\nHe seems to have something to say.\\n\\n\\nQ: What\\'s an example of a movie review?\\nAn example of a movie review is here: This Raggedy Ann and Andy Movie is so adorable. We love watching Ann and Andy sing and dance, along with the camel with the wrinkled knees. This movie is what made the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees so popular, singing his song, \"I\\'m nobodies I Love You\".

Come on, guys, a film isn't and shouldn't be a biography (nor a novel!). Any historical film distorts reality, because it should be a work of art in its own right.

A British holidaymaker canoeing in the Amazonian rainforest was snatched at gunpoint by a gang of kidnappers. Kathryn Cox was dragged away from the river and into the jungle where she was robbed. The 28-year-old accountant was then abandoned in the middle of a remote nature reserve – teeming with alligators and anacondas – when her panicked kidnappers realised the military was closing in on them. Scroll down for video. Rescued: Kathryn Cox (centre, with blonde hair), 23, and Fiona Wilde (brunette, alongside Miss Cox) after their rescue by more than 100 soldiers. Yesterday, after an operation involving more than 100 soldiers, police. and park rangers, Miss Cox and her fellow\\xa0 hostage, Fiona Louise Wilde,. were rescued close to the lawless Colombian border after a farmer heard. their cries for help. They were said to be in ‘good condition’ last night despite their terrifying ordeal in the steamingly hot rainforest. Their nightmare began on Friday afternoon as they travelled towards. Ecuador’s Cuyabeno National Park with three other foreign tourists and. two local guides. The nature reserve – made up of rivers, lagoons and forest\\xa0 covering. 2,000 square miles –\\xa0 is home to more than 500 different species of. birds, pink freshwater dolphins, 250 species of fish, including piranha,. and alligators. Kathryn Cox, pictured, and her fellow hostage were rescued close to the lawless Colombian border after a farmer heard their cries for help. The pair had booked the four to five-day expedition with a local tour. company after arriving in the Tarapoa region of Sucumbios province, in. the north-east of Ecuador. The kidnappers – whom locals say have links to a notorious Colombian. drug-running gang – robbed the tourists of their cameras and phones. before taking Miss Cox, from Limpsfield in Surrey, and\\xa0 Australian Miss. Wilde, 32, at gunpoint and escaping into the forest. The women were. abandoned later that evening after their kidnappers realised they were. being tracked. The traumatised pair were then forced to spent the night alone before their cries for help were heard by a passing farmer. A source said that the women were also being tracked by the\\xa0 military. after one kidnapper used a mobile phone, allowing his whereabouts to be. traced. The Foreign Office advises\\xa0 against visiting the area because of the. risk of organised crime. It\\xa0 also warns that ‘express kidnappings’ –. where victims are held for a short time as criminals empty their bank. accounts using their bank cards – are common along the Ecuador-Colombia. border. There have reportedly been more than 100 kidnappings in the area over. the past year and the border is notorious for drugs barons. Katga Saubert, 43, who owns a tour company called Magic River in the. same area as the kidnapping, said: ‘It is happening all over\\xa0 Ecuador. and not just here. It is because of the social problems and the poverty. Perhaps there should be better security.’ Cuyabeno reserve where the women were rescued in the steamingly-hot rainforest. Lawless territory: Miss Cox and Miss Wilde were kidnapped while travelling by canoe with a group of tourists in a remote nature reserve in the Amazon jungle. Locals were also quick to blame a criminal gang called the Black Eagles,. which is made up of ex-paramilitaries. Miss Cox’s parents, optometrist. Neil, who owns his own practice, and radiographer Averin, said they were. too upset to speak. However, her brother Andy, has told neighbours:. ‘She is doing well. She is okay.’ Neighbours say that Miss Cox decided to go travelling in South America after breaking up with her long-term, live-in boyfriend. She left her job as a senior assessment manager with NHS watchdog. Monitor and visited Brazil, before arriving in Ecuador this month. Last night Jose Serrano, Ecuador’s interior minister, said the women. were ‘in good condition’ and had been flown to a hospital in the capital. Quito to be examined. His department posted a photograph of the pair on. Twitter last night, dressed in army fatigues. The women were snatched in Ecuador\\'s Sucumbios. Province: Local reports suggest a crime gang called the Black Eagles,. consisting of ex-paramilitaries, might have been behind the abduction. Relations between the UK and Ecuador have been strained in recent months. by the country’s decision to grant asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian. Assange. The 41-year-old, who is currently holed up in London’s Ecuadorian. Embassy, is wanted by Swedish police for questioning in relation\\xa0 to. rape and sexual assault allegations. He denies the claims.

Timothy Jones Jr., 32, is being held in Smith County on child endangerment charges and is awaiting extradition to South Carolina for prosecution. The children, reported missing from South Carolina last week, were found dead in Alabama on Tuesday, authorities said. Their remains were discovered off a dirt road in Wilcox County, said Sgt. Steve Jarrett of the Alabama Department of Public Safety. Jones led law enforcement to the crime scene, Jarrett said. No other details were immediately available about how the children died. A multi-state search for the children and their father involved the FBI and state law enforcement agencies. It was launched after the mother told Lexington County, South Carolina, sheriff\\'s investigators on September 3 that she has been unable to contact her former husband. \"Neighbors told deputies that the children\\'s father said he was moving with his children from his home near Lexington to another state,\" said Lexington Sheriff Lewis McCarty. Jones and the children\\'s mother were divorced. They shared custody of the children, according to the Lexington County, South Carolina, Sheriff\\'s office. On Saturday, Jones was taken into custody in Mississippi on suspicion of driving under the influence. When his SUV was towed, authorities found evidence of a crime, the state\\'s Department of Public Safety said. A check of the National Criminal Information Center found he was wanted in South Carolina. Missing nursing student\\'s remains found in Tennessee.

They would score first in the first quarter when Ben Roethlisberger found Xavier Grimble on a 1-yard pass (with a failed PAT) to make it 6-0. The Packers scored 2 touchdowns to close out the first half. The first one followed an interception thrown by Roethlisberger when QB Brett Hundley found Randall Cobb on a 39-yard pass to make it 7-6. The Steelers' defense also stalled later on in the quarter when Hundley found Jamaal Williams on a 54-yard pass to make it 14-6 in favor of the Packers. In the second quarter, the Steelers managed to tie the game when Roethlisberger found Martavis Bryant on a 17-yard pass (with a successful 2-point conversion) to make the score 14-14 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Packers retook the lead when Hundley found Davante Adams on a 55-yard pass to make it 21-14. Later on, the Steelers tied it back up when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 1-yard pass to make it 21-21. The Steelers managed to take the lead when Roethlisberger and Brown hooked up again this time on a 33-yard pass to make it 28-21. The Packers would tie it up later on in the quarter when Williams ran for a 4-yard touchdown to make it 28-28. With seconds left, Chris Boswell would put up the game-winning 53-yard field goal to make the final score 31-28. The game marked the Steelers' first victory while suffering a negative-3 turnover ratio since defeating the Cincinnati Bengals on December 2, 2007. It was also the Steelers' fifth consecutive regular season win over the Packers, as well as their fifth consecutive win over the Packers in Pittsburgh. The Steelers' 462 yards of offense represented their most since December 6, 2015 against the Indianapolis Colts.\\nWhich player had the longest scoring play of the game?\\n\\nA: Davante Adams\\n\\n\\nQ: Hoping to maintain their winning streak the Ravens flew to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC North rivalry match against the Bengals. In the 2nd quarter Baltimore trailed early as kicker Mike Nugent hit a 36 and a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter the Ravens replied and took the lead with QB Joe Flacco completing a 31-yard TD pass to WR Derrick Mason. The Bengals replied when Nugent hit a 46-yard field goal. The Ravens took the lead back in the fourth quarter when kicker Billy Cundiff got a 38-yard field goal, but it was cut off by Nugent's 38 and 25-yard field goal, giving Baltimore a loss.\\nHow many field goals did Nugent hit?\\n\\nA: 5\\n\\n\\nQ: The Greco-Turkish War of 1919-1922 was fought between Greece and the Turkish National Movement during the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire after World War I between May 1919 and October 1922. It is known as the Western Front  of the Turkish War of Independence in Turkey and the Asia Minor Campaign  or the Asia Minor Catastrophe  in Greece. The Greek campaign was launched primarily because the western Allies, particularly British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, had promised Greece territorial gains at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, recently defeated in World War I. The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in Smyrna , on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of Manisa, Balıkesir, Aydın, Kütahya, Bursa and Eskişehir. Their advance was checked at the Battle of Sakarya in 1921 by forces of the Turkish national movement. The Greek front collapsed with the Turkish counter-attack in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the recapture of Smyrna by the Turkish forces and the Great Fire of Smyrna. As a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish national movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving East Thrace and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the Treaty of Sèvres to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The Treaty of Lausanne recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor, Constantinople, and Eastern Thrace. Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in a population exchange.\\nWhen did the Greco-Turkish war end?\\n\\nA: \\n\\n\\nQ: The Packers started hot and never looked back, cruising to an easy win over the Eagles, who were tied for the best record in the NFL. The Packers took the ball and went 75 yards, with the big play being Aaron Rodgers hooking up with Jordy Nelson for 65 yards. However, two incomplete passes forced the Packers to settle for a 27-yard Mason Crosby field goal. After an Eagles punt, the Packers stormed 88 yards in 13 plays, taking 6:47 off the clock, ending with Rodgers connecting with DaVante Adams for a 6-yard touchdown pass. Rodgers continued to show that the Eagles' secondary was no match. The Eagles went three-and-out on their next drive, but this time Micah Hyde returned the punt 75 yards for a touchdown, extending the Packers lead to 17-0 in the first quarter. The Eagles finally managed points on their next drive, going 44 yards in 10 plays before Cody Parkey hit a 33-yard field goal with 13:08 remaining in the half. Unfortunately, for the Eagles, there was no stopping Aaron Rodgers. The Packers advanced 80 yards in only 6 plays, with Rodgers throwing for 60 yard on the drive, including the 27-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. The Eagles offense continued to sputter, punting on their next possession. The Packers continued their utter domination, moving to the Eagles 19 yard-line, but Malcolm Jenkins was flagged for pass interference in the end zone, moving the ball to the 1 yard-line. Eddie Lacy took it in on the very next play(the Packers two-point conversion attempt was unsuccessful) and the Packers led 30-3 with just 2:00 minutes left in the half. On their next drive, the Eagles managed to move 65 yards and Cody Parkey hit his second field goal of the half, trimming the score to 30-6 at halftime. The Eagles drove into Packer territory on their first possession of the second half, but Mark Sanchez lost a fumble that was recovered by Nick Perry. The Packers punted for the first time all night on their next drive, but the Eagles did nothing, punting themselves. The Packers proceeded to march 48 yards and Crosby was successful from 33 yards away, giving the Packers a 33-6 lead. On the following drive Mark Sanchez continued to give up the ball, with defensive end Julius Peppers returning an interception 52 yards for a touchdown making the score 39-6(Crosby's PAT was blocked). Sanchez drove the Eagles 80 yards, hitting Jordan Matthews 10 yards for a touchdown, closing the gap to 39-13. Rodgers responded by hitting Lacy 32 yards for a touchdown on a screen pass. Sanchez threw his second interception of the night on the next possession, but Crosby missed a field goal. Once again Sanchez turned it over (this time on a fumble), and Casey Hayward returned it 49 yards for a touchdown, making the score a humiliating, 53-13. Sanchez hit Jeremy Maclin for a 20-yard touchdown pass on the next Eagle possession, to close the scoring, giving the Packers a 53-20 victory. The Packers out gained the Eagles 475-429, but four turnovers (all by Sanchez) buried the Eagles.\\nWhich team lost by 33 points?\\n\\nA:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: Background: Donald Christopher Barber (born 17 April 1930) is an English jazz musician, best known as a bandleader and trombonist. As well as scoring a UK top twenty trad jazz hit, he helped the careers of many musicians, notably the blues singer Ottilie Patterson, who was at one time his wife, and vocalist/banjoist Lonnie Donegan, whose appearances with Barber triggered the skiffle craze of the mid-1950s and who had his first transatlantic hit, \"Rock Island Line\", while with Chris Barber\\'s band. His providing an audience for Donegan and, later, Alexis Korner makes Barber a significant figure in the British rhythm and blues and \"beat boom\" of the 1960s.\\nContext: The 2017 line up is; Chris Barber and Bob Hunt (trombones); Mike Henry and Pete Rudeforth (trumpets), Bert Brandsma, Nick White and Ian Killoran (clarinets and alto sax, tenor sax, baritone sax). John Watson (drums), John Day (double bass), Joe Farler (banjo & guitar) Pat Halcox, trumpeter with the Chris Barber Band since 31 May 1954, retired after playing his last gig with the Big Chris Barber Band on 16 July 2008. Halcox and Barber were together in the band for 54 years - the longest continuous partnership in the history of jazz, exceeding even that of Duke Ellington and Harry Carney (48 years between 1926 and 1974). Tony Carter (reeds) also left the band at this time. Vic Pitt (double bass) retired in January 2007 after 30 years with the band.  His feature duet with the drummers of the day - \"Big Noise From Winnetka\" was not only a feature of the Barber concerts, but also his time with the Kenny Ball band immediately before. When Amy Roberts joined the band in 2011, she was still a student at Royal Northern College of Music and thus not always able to be present. On several tours Bert Brandsma (reeds) replaced her. Brandsma joined as a permanent member in 2012.  At St Luke\\'s, London, on 9 June 2007 Barber appeared in the horn section of Nick Lowe\\'s band during a concert. In 2008 Barber, along with Eric Clapton and others, were involved in a new co-operative record company, Blues Legacy. On 23 July 2009, Barber, Bilk and Ball played a one-off concert at Indigo2 at the O2 in Greenwich. The concert was presented by the British Music Experience. He performed at De Doelen in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on 12 December 2010.\\nQuestion: who was the second longest\\nAnswer: Duke Ellington and Harry Carney (48 years between 1926 and 1974).\\nIN: Drusilla, or Dru, is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt for the American television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. The character is portrayed by American actress Juliet Landau. Drusilla is introduced alongside her lover Spike (James Marsters) in the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to serve as new antagonists to the series\\' heroine, vampire Slayer Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and alongside Darla (Julie Benz) and Wolfram & Hart as the main antagonist of the second season of Angel. In contrast to the series\\' previous central villain, the ancient and ceremonious Master (Mark Metcalf), Spike and Dru were introduced as a more unconventional but equally dangerous pair of vampires.\\n\\nDrusilla has all the standard powers and vulnerabilities of a vampire, plus minor psychic abilities. She is immortal, regenerates damage, drains human blood to survive, and is stronger than most humans. Drusilla\\'s technique in combat, although awkward-looking, has allowed her to briefly hold her own in a fight against Angel (in \"Reunion\") and Spike (in \"Becoming, Part Two\"), along with besting Kendra the Vampire Slayer (in \"Becoming, Part One\") before using the hypnosis technique and then killing her. It was also in this fight with Kendra that Drusilla showed that her fingernails are sharper than one would normally expect, as she uses them to slit Kendra\\'s throat. Darla had demonstrated a similar technique when she sired Angel; whether this is due to vampiric abilities or physical manipulation of nails is unclear.  Drusilla is also a seer with minor psychic abilities. However, since she had these before becoming a vampire their source and cause are unknown. She receives vivid visions that contain possible glimpses of the future, and can also see into people\\'s minds and project false imagery into them (e.g. in \"Becoming, Part Two\", when she convinces Giles that she is really Jenny Calendar). She is also capable of hypnotizing people, which she does by catching their gazes, pointing her fingers towards her victim\\'s eyes and then to her own, whispering to them (\"Be in my eyes, Be in me\"). Drusilla uses this technique to murder Kendra in the episode \"Becoming, Part One\". The Master uses a similar skill to paralyze Buffy in \"Prophecy Girl\".  Like all vampires, she is vulnerable to holy items and sunlight, can be killed by decapitation or a stake to the heart, and cannot enter the home of a living human without first being invited by someone who lives there.\\n\\nWhat is an example of one of Drusilla\\'s powers?\\n\\nOUT: plus minor psychic abilities.\\nBackground: Stanley Kirk Burrell (born March 30, 1962), better known by his stage name MC Hammer (or simply Hammer), is an American hip hop recording artist, dancer, record producer and entrepreneur. He had his greatest commercial success and popularity from the late 1980s, until the early 1990s. Remembered for his rapid rise to fame, Hammer is known for hit records (such as \"U Can\\'t Touch This\" and \"2 Legit 2 Quit\"), flashy dance movements, choreography and eponymous Hammer pants. A multi-award winner, M.C. Hammer is considered a \"forefather/pioneer\" and innovator of pop rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music), and is the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status for an album.\\nContext: Before Hammer\\'s successful music career (with his mainstream popularity lasting approximately between 1988 and 1998) and his \"rags-to-riches-to-rags-and-back saga\", Burrell formed a Christian rap music group with CCM\\'s Jon Gibson (or \"J.G.\") called Holy Ghost Boys. Some songs produced were called \"Word\" and \"B-Boy Chill\". \"The Wall\", featuring Burrell (it was originally within the lyrics of this song he first identified himself as K.B. and then eventually M.C. Hammer once it was produced), was later released on Gibson\\'s album Change of Heart (1988). This was Contemporary Christian music\\'s first rap hit ever. Burrell also produced \"Son of the King\" at that time, releasing it on his debut album. \"Son of the King\" showed up on Hammer\\'s debut album Feel My Power (1987), as well as the re-released version Let\\'s Get It Started (1988).  With exception to later remixes of early releases, Hammer produced and recorded many rap songs that were never made public, yet are now available on the Internet. Via his record labels such as Bust It Records, Oaktown Records and FullBlast, Hammer has introduced, signed and produced new talent including Oaktown\\'s 3.5.7, Ho Frat Hoo!, the vocal quintet Special Generation, Analise, James Greer, One Cause One Effect, B Angie B, The Stooge Playaz, DASIT (as seen on ego trip\\'s The (White) Rapper Show), Teabag, Common Unity, Geeman and Pleasure Ellis; both collaborating with him and producing music of their own during his career.  At about the age of 12, Oakland native Keyshia Cole recorded with Hammer and sought career advice from him.\\nQuestion: What label produced his music?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Question:\\nLewis Fry Richardson was the youngest of seven children born to Catherine Fry (1838-1919) and David Richardson (1835-1913). They were a prosperous Quaker family, David Richardson operating a successful tanning and leather manufacturing business. At age 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, Bootham School in York, where he received an education in science, which stimulated an active interest in natural history. In 1898 he went on to Durham College of Science (a college of Durham University) where he took courses in mathematical physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology.\\nRichardson also applied his mathematical skills in the service of his pacifist principles, in particular in understanding the basis of international conflict. For this reason, he is now considered the initiator, or co-initiator (with Quincy Wright and Pitirim Sorokin as well as others such as Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapaport and Adam Curle), of the scientific analysis of conflict--an interdisciplinary topic of quantitative and mathematical social science dedicated to systematic investigation of the causes of war and conditions of peace. As he had done with weather, he analysed war using mainly differential equations and probability theory. Considering the armament of two nations, Richardson posited an idealised system of equations whereby the rate of a nation\\'s armament build-up is directly proportional to the amount of arms its rival has and also to the grievances felt toward the rival, and negatively proportional to the amount of arms it already has itself. Solution of this system of equations allows insightful conclusions to be made regarding the nature, and the stability or instability, of various hypothetical conditions which might obtain between nations.  He also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations was a function of the length of their common border. And in Arms and Insecurity (1949), and Statistics of Deadly Quarrels (1960), he sought to analyse the causes of war statistically. Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion. In the preface of the latter, he wrote: \"There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions. My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer.\"  In Statistics of Deadly Quarrels Richardson presented data on virtually every war from 1815 to 1945. As a result, he hypothesized a base 10 logarithmic scale for conflicts. In other words, there are many more small fights, in which only a few people die, than large ones that kill many. While no conflict\\'s size can be predicted beforehand--indeed, it is impossible to give an upper limit to the series--overall they do form a Poisson distribution. On a smaller scale he showed the same pattern for gang murders in Chicago and Shanghai. Others have noted that similar statistical patterns occur frequently, whether planned (lotteries, with many more small payoffs than large wins), or by natural organisation (there are more small towns with grocery stores than big cities with superstores).\\nAnswer this question using a quote from the text above:\\n\\nWhat else did Richardson do?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nAs a result, he hypothesized a base 10 logarithmic scale for conflicts.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nHaydn Austin Bunton (born 5 April 1937) is a former Australian rules footballer and coach. The son of the legendary Haydn Bunton Sr., Bunton Jr. played for North Adelaide and Norwood in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), as well as Swan Districts and Subiaco in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Bunton was regarded as a tough and skilful player in both South Australia and Western Australia, but it was as a coach that he cemented a reputation alongside his father as one of Australian football\\'s greatest identities. Bunton was inducted into the coaches section of the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 1996, as well as the Western Australian Institute of Sport Hall of Champions in 2003 and was made an inaugural member of the WA Football Hall of Fame in 2004 and the SA Football Hall of Fame in 2002.\\nBorn in Caulfield, Victoria, Bunton Jr. moved with his father first to Western Australia and then to South Australia. Bunton was hospitalised for two years from the age of three due to a fractured pelvis and Perthes disease in his hip. He wore leg braces and used crutches until he was aged ten.  Haydn Bunton junior made his debut for North Adelaide at the age of 17, and two years seasons later was named an All-Australian player. In 1955, Bunton senior was killed in a car crash, but the following year, the younger Bunton showed his class as a player by finishing runner-up for the Magarey Medal to Dave Boyd. The following year, Haydn \"stood out\" as a player due to a transfer dispute with North Adelaide, who would not clear him, but amazingly served as a non-playing coach of Norwood. From 1958 to 1960, he played for Norwood, in spite of a serious knee injury sustained in a car accident in Tasmania in 1959.  Bunton had another strong year in 1961, when he was recruited by Swan Districts in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) as captain-coach. At the time Swan Districts were the Cinderella side of the WAFL, having never won more than seven games in a season since 1945, and were generally regarded with \"pity or scorn\". Swan Districts had lost their last sixteen games of 1960, but improved immediately under Bunton\\'s coaching. They won 12 and drew two of twenty-one matches to finish second, but after a loss to raging hot premiership favourite East Perth in the second semi final they were not considered a serious threat. However, after overcoming Subiaco in the preliminary, Bunton developed an ingenious tactic to counter Royals\\' champion Polly Farmer by using both Keith Slater and Fred Castledine in the ruck contests. Though this ploy was technically illegal, it was accepted by the umpires, and Swan Districts won by 24 points for their first WAFL premiership. In the process of lifting Swan Districts from cellar-dwellers to premiers, Bunton developed a use of handball that was far ahead of its time and also discouraged the use of the erratic drop kick.  The following year Bunton won the Sandover Medal for the league\\'s \"fairest and best\", completing a rare father-and-son achievement. Swan Districts took their first minor premiership and won both the second semi and grand finals against East Fremantle. Despite finishing fourth after the home-and-away rounds, Swan Districts managed to win three finals and a hat-trick of premierships in 1963; however, 1964 saw the team collapse to sixth of eight clubs with only nine wins.  Bunton returned to Norwood as playing coach from 1965 until 1967, bringing his total number of games for Norwood to 97. In his first season the club played off in the finals, but they slowly declined in 1966 and 1967 finishing seventh of ten teams.\\nAnswer this question using a quote from the text above:\\n\\nDid Haydn play for other teams during his career?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n'},\n",

It allows you and your group to carry everything you need for a successful and safe hike. Backpacking is also an exhausting endeavor. Evaluate your physical and mental strength before committing to a backpacking trip. This will help both you and your group. Most modern backpacks are top loaded giving you access to the main compartment through the top. The bottom of your pack should be reserved for items to be used in setting up camp like a tent. All heavy items should be positioned in the center of the pack. This includes pots, pans and other cookware. The top portion of your pack should include all the supplies you might need during your hike like snacks, tools, and a map. Check if your program provides a backpack for campers. Some will allow you to bring your own. You’ll probably need an extended trip or multi-day pack. These are anywhere from 50 liters to larger. Get fit for your backpack at an outdoors store to avoid injury. You will definitely need certain supplies regardless of your trip. These supplies include a headlamp, sunscreen, matches/lighter, multi-tool pocket knife, and a water bottle.  Most camps won’t require you to bring food and cookware. You could play it safe by bringing nuts or other types of energy snacks. Make sure you bring a strong sealable bag to avoid animals from interfering with you. For a summer backpacking trip you should bring multiple wicking t-shirts and underwear. Wicking material allows air to breath through your clothes. You should also bring a rain jacket, sweatshirt, and a baseball cap or a hat that shades your face. Every program is different. Some trips specialize in winter backpacking trips. These are intense trips that require additional planning and preparation.\\nSummary: Understand backpacking. Understand packing a backpack. Pick a backpack. Gather additional supplies. Pack the right clothing. Check the program’s recommendations.\\n\\nINPUT ARTICLE: Article: Buying an engagement ring isn’t as simple a task as going to a store and picking out something. Armed with your fiancée's preferences and a little information about the different components of engagement rings, you can easily make the right choice. Any ring is made up of two parts, the setting and the stone. There are countless combinations of metals, stones, shapes, and cuts you can combine for your fiancée’s perfect engagement ring. The setting is ring’s metal framework and enhances the beauty of a stone. Settings are normally in the following metals: gold (which comes in yellow, white, or rose), platinum, or palladium. Silver is also an option. Platinum is hypoallergenic and an excellent choice for someone with sensitive skin. Once you’ve decided on a what metal you would like for the setting, you can figure out what style setting you’d like. There are many options such as vintage, pavé, bezel, or channel set.  You can also choose a setting after you’ve chosen your stone. Often, the brilliance of a stone is influenced by the setting’s metal. For example, colorless diamonds look best in white gold or platinum because yellow gold casts slight yellow tint onto a clear stone.  Two other options are custom settings and vintage or heirloom rings. Jewelers can craft custom engagement rings that specifically fit your fiancée’s personality, taste, and size. A jeweler will let you choose the setting, setting style and a stone or stones you like. You can buy quality vintage or heirloom rings from jewelers, or even from websites like Ebay. Estate sales are another place to find vintage or heirloom pieces. This is arguably the most difficult part of buying an engagement ring because a stone has so many variables. The stone is what is placed into a setting and is the central focus of any engagement ring. The 4C’s- cut, clarity, color, and carats (or stone size)- are the characteristics of a stone and dictate its price. If you are socially conscious, you may want to consider purchasing a “conflict free diamond,” which are stones that have not funded civil war or human rights abuses in African combat zones. Traditionally, engagement rings are clear diamonds. Colorless, round, brilliant cut diamonds are still the most popular for engagement rings.  People are increasingly adding other gemstones, such as sapphires, emeralds, or rubies to their engagement rings, either as the center stone or to frame the center stone. Fancy colored diamonds in yellow, pink, or blue are also popular- and expensive because of their rarity.  Colors are rated on a scale of colorless (D grade) to light tint (N-Z grades).Aim to purchase color grade “H” and above so that the stone doesn’t have too much of a yellow tint. This refers to the stone’s shape, which is cut by a qualified jeweler.  Cut is considered the most important factor for beauty. A poor cut can make the stone look dull.  Some examples of different cuts include: round, princess, emerald, and radiant. Cushion and Asscher cuts are considered “fancy” and are generally more expensive.  Aim to purchase cut grade “very good” or above, which will guarantee your stone sparkles brilliantly. Carats refer the size of a stone. The more carats a stone has, the larger its surface area. Ring prices increase with carat weight.  Each carat is divided into 100 points: if you have a one carat ring with 50 points, it is equal to 1.5 carats.  If your fiancée wants a higher carat weight ring and cost is an issue, one tip is to get a stone with a larger surface area and shallower cut. This way, you’ll get the size without a significant increase in price. A stone’s clarity measures imperfections, also called inclusions. The less inclusions a ring has, the more it will sparkle- and cost.  Clarity is graded on a scale from “FL” (flawless) to “SI” (some inclusions” to “I” (imperfect).  Grades “VS” (very small inclusions) and “SI” (small inclusions) are considered “fine quality” stones.\\n\\nSUMMARY:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: By. John Stevens, Political Reporter. Support: The proposal is backed by some of the Prime Minister\\'s closest allies including Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured) Newly retired workers from a range of different fields will be parachuted in to teach at Britain’s toughest schools under Tory manifesto plans. Recent retirees will enrol on an intensive course to retrain as teachers, before being fast-tracked into schools in inner cities and other deprived areas. The Teach Seniors programme will be based on Teach First, which has seen thousands of high-flying graduates heading into the classroom. It is hoped it will encourage professionals from a broad spectrum of careers to work as teachers before fully retiring, using their experience to educate the next generation. The proposal is currently being considered by David Cameron and MP Jo Johnson, Boris’s younger brother, who is drafting the Conservatives’ general election manifesto. It is supported by some of the Prime Minister’s closest allies and is the brainchild of the 2020 Group, which presented the idea to him at Downing Street. One of those involved in the presentation said: ‘Teach First has seen a lot of talented younger people going into schools before embarking on other careers. This would follow the same logic but in reverse, with people who have already had careers opting to go into the classroom. ‘For example someone who has been working as a chemical engineer might teach science and would have a lot of experience to give to younger people.’ The 2020 Group includes about a quarter of the 305 Tory MPs and promotes ‘a modern progressive Conservatism’. It is made up of some of Mr Cameron’s most loyal supporters, with Education Secretary Michael Gove among its members. The group, which was founded by energy and climate change minister Greg Barker, also includes ministers Justine Greening, Helen Grant, David Willetts, Theresa Villiers, Nicky Morgan and Sajid Javid. One member said Teach Seniors was one of a ‘whole range of exciting, aspirational and optimistic ideas’ that had been presented for consideration. Teach First has seen thousands of high-calibre graduates enter the classroom after just a six-week course in teaching. Founded by former City business consultant Brett Wigdortz in 2002, it takes on more than 1,000 graduates a year with 2:1 degrees or above, who want to avoid the traditional teacher-training path. Originally aimed solely at secondary schools in London, it has been expanded to include primary schools and now covers ten regions across England and Wales. Teach First has proved popular with students wanting to try teaching, but has been criticised by unions, which argue that participants do not receive enough training before they are placed in charge of a class. Before starting in schools, participants attend the Summer Institute, a residential course where they study educational theory and practice. Trainees are required to stay in the classroom for only two years, and many sign up to hone skills such as communication, which they believe will help them in future careers in different fields. But more than half stay in teaching and the most successful are fast-tracked into senior roles.\\n\\nWhat are highlight points?\\nAnswer: Retirees will enrol on an intensive course to retrain as teachers. Teach Seniors will be based. on Teach First, a training course for graduates. Backed by David Cameron\\'s supporters including Michael Gove.

A jilted boyfriend who stabbed his ex-girlfriend in the neck with a screwdriver outside her daughter\\'s primary school has been jailed for nine years. Crazed George Simpson, 58, ambushed Carol Bailey, 50, before wrestling her to the ground and attacking her with the tool. During the frenzied attack, which left the mother-of-six just minutes from death, he stabbed her nine times in the neck and screamed \\'I\\'m going to kill you, b***h.\\' Crazed attack: George Simpson, pictured left, stabbed Carol Bailey, right, in the neck with a screwdriver. Witnesses saw Simpson pacing up and down a road in Bentilee, Stoke-on-Trent, just minutes before he struck at 11am on May 21 this year. When police arrived they found Simpson weeping over her unconscious body and he admitted to officers what he had done. Simpson was jailed for nine years after he admitted attempted murder at Stafford Crown Court on Friday. Scene of the attack: Simpson stabbed his former partner close to her daughter\\'s primary school in Stoke-on-Trent. Jailing Simpson, Judge Simon Tonking told him: \\'You accept that you intended to kill Carol Bailey, and you very nearly succeeded. \\'When she got to hospital, the cardiac surgeon said she was dying, and close to death.\\xa0 She was only saved by his prompt action and that of others. \\'They carried out immediate open heart surgery to repair the damage that you had done. \\'As a result of that attack she has suffered lasting effects.\\xa0 She has scarring, and suffers from nightmares.\\' The court heard Simpson charged at Miss Bailey and wrestled her to the ground in the middle of the street before stabbing her outside the gates of Abbey Hulton Primary School. She was rushed to hospital where she underwent emergency open-heart surgery for a damaged pulmonary artery. Her condition was so bad that members of her family were banned from seeing her for 24 hours as medics said the slightest infection could kill her. David Bennett, prosecuting, said: \\'She was walking home on her own when she noticed the defendant. \\'He raced towards her and wrestled her to the ground. He said, \"I\\'m going to kill you, you b***h\".\\' Jailed: George Simpson, 58, was found guilty at Stafford Crown Court. The court heard Simpson, of Bentilee,. Staffordshire, had lived with Miss Bailey for 18 months but she had. ended the relationship after he punched and kicked her in January 2011. But he refused to accept the relationship was over and continued to bombard her with jealous emails and text messages before the savage attack. He also wrongly accused her of cheating him out of thousands of pounds for work he claimed he had carried out at her home. Patrick Thompson, defending, said: \\'He had only one caution against his name, and before this relationship he was of good character. \\'Because of the stress he was experiencing, he was suffering from a mental disorder at the time. \\'That is no defence, but that is something the court can properly take into account.\\' After the case, Detective Inspector Steve Maxfield, of Staffordshire Police, said: \\'This was a premeditated attempt by Simpson to seriously injure his former partner due to ongoing difficulties in their relationship. \\'Simpson was intent on harming his victim and used force as he inflicted several puncture wounds.\\'\\nHighlights:'},\n",

The flat breads were all great as were the tacos.  The pulled pork sliders were a little weak, but the food was very good overall.  The second time the horrible service reared its ugly head.  My girlfriend and I sat down and just under 20 minutes went by and no waiter came to see us.  The one guy I saw was absurdly overworked.  The poor kid seemed to have 10 tables and was bussing his own tables as well.  When we left the manager seemed genuinely apologetic and tried to offer us an appetizer.  I just can\\'t give my business to a place like this when there are plenty of restaurants in the city that are hustling to earn our business.

Okay, I wanted a little Oomph for my lashes and was really pretty sick of trying to glue-on those crazy fake ones I buy at MAC.  I would never take them off after an evening of festivities and they\\'d always end up on my forehead or on Hubby (\"gasp*).    I will say it takes a LONG time to get this done - about 3 hours for both eyes the first time you go - but you have to understand why.  Sherene takes lash by lash and glues them on to your own natural lashes.  It may not sound like a lot but to demonstrate, she put 120 lashes on one eye and about 130 lashes on the other.  Holy cow, its like surgery!  She does not rush the process or you which is really how we\\'d want it and she loves what she does.   I go back every 2-3 weeks or so to get maintenance on them and replace any sparse areas.  After my first appointment, I will admit it took a while to get used to the volume but I found myself even fluttering my new eyelashes to the bag boy at the grocery store.  I mean they look so amazing, you don\\'t need mascara at all on the top, only on the bottom ones.  Her place is really cute - a one room office on the lower level of the Satchi Salon.  She has great music on and makes sure you\\'re definitely comfy with blankets, etc.  If you wear contact lenses like me, you\\'ll want to bring your case and solution because you\\'ll have to pop them out for the process.    If you want gorgeous lashes, I would only go to Sherene.  I have read horror stories about other places and I know she does \"corrections\" for clients that went to somewhere else and had problems.  The only gripe I would have is that Sherene can be so detail oriented, she runs late.  If that bothers you, just take a deep breath in and remember how stunning your eyes will be after she\\'s done with you.\\n\\n\\ninput: Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\noutput: Horrible.

Chicken/Shrimp combo with steamed broccoli. Nacho were way over done and chicken fried steak was just average.   The place was pretty dirty as well. Teach in bathroom over flowing.

Honestly, I am left to think that they simply don't care.  I am not a perfectionist but I do expect a fair service when I am paying $16 for a car wash.  I was in an out in about 15 minutes if that gives you any indication of how detailed the workers were.  There were FIVE dried up smelly squares sitting on the back seat that had no fragrance; the mirrors were all out of whack; seats were pulled up as close as they could go; they didn't touch the dashboard; there was still hair on the carpets; before I got in the car I had to ask that they wipe down several spots on the outside including the white paint on the window; and my FOB doesn't beep now.  Come on, if you have to move the seats, I get that but move them back at least a little so I can get in.  There is no attention to detail, the inside of the windows look like a two year old was playing inside and we don't have small children.

In scientific terminology, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion (pericarp). The definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known as berries, such as grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, bananas, and chili peppers. Fruits excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are aggregate fruits; and mulberries, which are multiple fruits. A plant bearing berries is said to be bacciferous or baccate.\\nis a banana part of the berry family?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nOUT: yes\\n\\n\\nWhat's the best answer to this question: did india ever qualified for fifa world cup?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\nAnswer: yes\\n\\n\\nText: As the individuals prepare their plan of attack, Peter Pan (Robbie Kay) and Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) arrives at Skull Rock, where Pan tells Henry (who is unaware that Pan is actually his great grandfather) that he can save magic, and Henry believed him. As they enter the caves, Pan cast a protection spell to keep anyone with a shadow out. The individuals then reach the island, where Gold eventually penetrated the spell because he has no shadow. The other members finally believe that he wants to save Henry and Neal gives the box back to him, followed by Regina and Emma casting an eclipse spell so they can enter. Henry and Pan finally enter a large chamber that contains a large hourglass on top of a pedestal of golden skulls that shows the magic slowly fading, indicating how much time is left for magic in Neverland. After looking at this, Pan tells Henry it is time to save magic, but he now wants to use Henry's heart rather than believing in it, then lies to Henry that he'll live forever in Neverland if he does this. He then is interrupted by a presence, as Gold shows up to confront his father and to stop him from going through with this and takes out the box. Pan says they are really alike because both abandoned their sons, but Gold says he regretted leaving his son the moment he let him go and spent the rest of his life trying to get him back. Pan then responds ``Why do you think I call myself Peter Pan?'' and asks Gold to put the box down so they can make a fresh start. After Gold refuses, he waves his hand over the box but nothing happens, as Gold discovers Pan switched boxes, and Pan waves his hand over the real one and places Gold inside it. Pan then returns to finish his scheme to take Henry's heart by giving him magic to allow him to remove it. As Henry succeeds in doing so, Emma, Regina and Neal arrive to stop Henry from giving it to Pan, but Pan tells Henry that they are lying to him because they are adults even as they tell Henry they believe in him because they love him. Unfortunately, Henry, believing that he can save magic, gives his heart to Pan, who has now emerged victorious in his plot to become immortal. Henry dies as a result.\\n\\nQuestion: does rumpelstiltskin know peter pan is his father?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n[separator]\\nAnswer: yes\\n\\n\\nIN: Xbox Live Gold is a paid subscription service for the Xbox community. Signing up to Xbox Live is free, but, with the exception of the Windows 10 version, in order to play online and access some core services, a periodic fee is required. Features that require a Gold subscription include online gaming, matchmaking/smartmatch, private chat, party chat and in-game voice communication. Other features, such as game recording and media sharing also necessitate Gold membership. Similarly, ordinary Xbox Live members can download and access the Twitch live streaming application, but in order to broadcast gameplay of one's own, a Gold subscription is necessary. Free-to-play titles also remain behind a paywall. Subscribers are benefited with space ``in the cloud'' for storing files, and granted early or exclusive access to betas, special offers, Games with Gold, and Video Kinect.\\nare there different types of xbox live memberships?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nOUT:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Sentiment analysis: OK, this review was because of Jeremy P. 11/29/2012. Except for the Shimagamo comment which I don\\'t agree...  I DON\"T NEED TO WRITE A REVIEW because he said everything to a T. I could of not gone to a dirtier looking place that I thought I would actually get sick off the cracked wood blocks. Jeremy P. said everything I would of said: EXACTLY. I will cut and past for those who can\\'t find his review, here goes:  \"In how many different ways can you arrange the same ten ingredients?  If this were a contest, Temari would win, hands down.  This looked like one of the most promising places in a very generic East Valley sushi scene, so we decided to give it a shot.  When I sat down, our eager waiter asked me what I\\'d like to drink.  I asked him if they only have fountain sodas, and he looked at me like I was speaking Greek.  I said, \"What do you have, bottles?\"  He said they don\\'t have cans or anything; it just comes out of a gun.  So... Fountain sodas then.  Got it.  My friend said his Mr. Pibb tasted off, and asked to switch to Coke.  He said sure, but he\\'ll have to pay for the Coke.  Now, on to the food.... I looked at the menu.  I saw about three pages of rolls.  I looked at the specials board.  More rolls.  Looked at the regular menu.... Standard Japanese fare.  They have teriyaki.  TERIYAKI!  Who eats teriyaki?  This isn\\'t Samurai Sam\\'s, is it?  They have some sashimi.  All very standard cuts of fish.  Tuna, white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, sea bass, and mackerel is probably all they had.  Maybe the weakest selection I\\'ve seen, well, anywhere.  The nigiri sushi (which I\\'m pretty sure I heard our waiter pronounce as \"NIGH gi ri\" sushi to the diners at the next table) was pretty standard as well.  Ra has better selection.  Yes, that\\'s right, Ra, one of the most notoriously generic sushi restaurants in the world, has a better selection of fish than Temari!  Anyways, at about six different points while I was looking through the tome they call a \"specials menu\" (which consists of about 99.5% rolls, plus tuna poke), our eager waiter asked us if we know what we would like yet.  Sorry, bro, can\\'t you see I\\'m reading here!  I\\'m like half way through!  My eyes are getting tired from reading the words \"spicy tuna,\" \"eel sauce,\" and \"chili sauce\" so much!  Because 75% of the rolls have one of more of those ingredients!  It was amazing how many different rolls they had, yet how few of them actually sounded appealing.  Most of them seemed to be more focused on sauces and spice than actual fish flavor.  It\\'s like people who eat sushi in Gilbert don\\'t want to taste the awful flavor of fish!  Gross, right!  Fish, ugh!  I pointed out to my friend that one particular roll \"has like three sauces: chili sauce, eel sauce, garlic citrus sauce, and kiwi sauce. Four sauces!\" (imagine the Spanish Inquisition.)  Anyways, about our actual order: we went with the \"chef\\'s choice\" sashimi platter, a romantic roll (cucumber with a bunch of stuff inside), a sunkist roll (some fish completely drowned in citrus flavor), and amaebi and quail egg sushi.  I think \"chef\\'s choice\" means \"cheapest,\" because no real sushi chef would put both tuna and salmon on his own plate if he were picking what he wanted to eat.  The sashimi itself was OK I guess.  The rolls were very boring, as we expected.  The sweet shrimp was good, but you can tell what type of clientele they have when they placed the heads on our table, and the diners at the next table over seemed awestruck by the fact that someone would actually eat a shrimp head, what with those cute little eyeballs staring at them.  This brings me to the conclusion of this review: this place utterly destroyed our hope of finding a good sushi bar in the East Valley.  Shimogamo was respectable, but even there, the owner was unable to keep the best cuts of fish in stock because he had no confidence his clientele would buy enough of it to keep it fresh.  This is the East Valley.  People think sushi is a bunch of rolls.  You ask an East Valley denizen about their favorite sushi place, and they say, \"I like this place, they have great rolls!\"  Only here can a sushi bar stock just seven cuts of fish, and just offer 500 rolls with the same ten ingredients, and maybe serve some teriyaki chicken for those who REALLY hate sushi, and be successful.  I think we\\'re going to look for the East Valley sushi bar with the lowest yelp rating, because that one is probably the best.  At least they didn\\'t end up charging us for that extra Coke.  Addendum: I was just reminded about the fortune cookie they served with dessert.  A fortune cookie!  At a Japanese Restaurant!  On the back of the fortune it said \"Learn Chinese.\"  Not making this up. \\\\u00ab show less \"  Sorry for coping your review BUT I couldn\\'t of said it better!!!!!\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n+++++++++\\nnegative\\n\\n\\nSentiment analysis: Famous Dave\\'s is always good when nothing else sounds good.  It isn\\'t super fancy or special, but it gets the job done when you want some traditional American BBQ quick!  The menu is diverse and has a lot of American favorites on the menu from BBQ beef, pork, and chicken, burgers, fish options, and even salads.  My favorite items are the BBQ pulled pork and the catfish fingers.  YUMMY! I will almost always get one or the other almost every time I visit a Famous Dave\\'s.  Hey, I know what I like!  They also have some great side items to add to your meal.  The spicy mac n\\' cheese is quite a highlight and delightful, if I do say so.  The desserts here are really pretty good as well.  My favorite new dessert is the Banana Pudding dessert.  It is really, really good!  I have to admit that it is at least as good or maybe even better than my mom\\'s Banana Pudding.  Yummy for your tummy! I also have to give props to Famous Dave\\'s because they have Sweet Tea!  It is so hard to find Sweet Tea out West, so whenever I do, I am all over it like white on rice.  I love me some Sweet Tea!  Yummy!  Overall, the food here is good, the service is good, and the price is low.  If you just can\\'t decide what you want to eat, you know you can find something good at Famous Dave\\'s.\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n+++++++++\\n'},\n",

Make sure the water is not too hot (or too cold) as this can irritate your vocal cords. For the best results, use filtered or bottled water. Mix the honey in the warm water until it is dissolved. At this point, you can also mix in herb extracts that have been recommended by your doctor. Mix three to five drops of the extract into the water. Herbs that are known to help sooth and heal your throat and vocal cords are cayenne pepper, licorice, marshmallow, propolis, sage, slippery elm and turmeric. Take a sip of the liquid and tilt your head back. Allow the liquid to go as far back in your throat as possible without swallowing it. Softly blow air from the back of your throat to start gargling. Make sure to spit out the liquid once you finish gargling.  For each session, gargle three times. Gargle every two to three hours throughout the day. Make sure to gargle before you go to bed.

Fill a large glass with ice water or chilled sparkling water, add 1 to 3 tablespoons (15 to 45 ml) of cordial and stir. You can also add elderflower cordial to lemonade, iced tea, and other drinks. Add one tablespoon (15 ml) of cordial to a glass of champagne or sparkling wine to make a fresh summer drink. You can also add a dash of cordial to a shot of vodka or gin served on the rocks with water, or to any fruity or floral cocktail. Flower and fruit flavors complement each other nicely, so you can add elderflower cordial to fruit salads to add some extra sweetness and a floral aroma. When your fruit salad is ready, drizzle a bit of cordial over top and give it one final stir before serving. Next time you have to make ice, fill the ice cube tray with water, then pour the water into a bowl. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of cordial, stir, and refill the ice cube trays. Freeze the ice and use in drinks, smoothies, and other concoctions. Next time you\\'re baking a cake, making icing or frosting, or enjoying a bowl of ice cream, add a floral hint with elderflower cordial.  For cakes and icings, replace vanilla extract with cordial and add an extra tablespoon or two (15 to 30 ml) of cordial.

Or, you may be looking to observe certain behaviors and mannerisms for a specific purpose. If you are looking to get information from people watching, set those goals beforehand so you know what to do as you watch. People watching is a great way to get fashion ideas and character designs for books, movies, and plays. People watching with another person is always more enjoyable. Grab a friend to sit and chat with you as you observe people. Don’t laugh at or make fun of people as you watch them with your friend. This can make people feel bad or uncomfortable. Avoid bringing a large group to people watch. This will only call attention to you, and your group of friends might get bored. You want to blend in with your surroundings. Avoid flashy shirts and lots of bling. Instead, opt for neutral colors and weather-appropriate clothes to become a person in the crowd rather than standing out as an observer. Avoid wearing large hats or glasses. If you’re people watching with a purpose, like character inspiration or costume design, you might be struck with a great idea while you are out. Take a notebook and a pencil with you when you people watch to write down any great observations or insights that you notice as you observe people. Be subtle as you write things down. Don’t stare right at someone and take notes on them. Instead, steal quick glances as you observe them from afar. Someone simply sitting and staring can be a little disconcerting to people walking by. If you don’t have a notebook, bring your phone or your laptop to look distracted as you sit and people watch. Act like you are typing a report or texting a friend instead of simply sitting and watching.  You can also bring a book or magazine to act like you are reading. Plug headphones into your phone or laptop to look even more inconspicuous. The most interesting part of people watching is making guesses about other people’s lives. To get the most out of your people watching experience, observe how people walk, talk, and interact with others to take guesses as to who they are and why they are here. People’s clothes also say a lot about them. Layers indicate they are prepared for the weather, while showing skin can mean confidence. Everyone has bad days sometimes. As you people watch, you may see some people who express behaviors you don’t quite agree with. Try to be an unbiased observer and simply take in what you see without making judgement calls on it. People may act differently when they don’t know they are being observed. Body language can say a lot about a person’s mood. Crossed arms can mean anger, hunched posture can mean sadness, and relaxed shoulders can indicate happiness. Pay attention to how people stand or sit and make guesses as to how they are feeling. Facial expressions are also a good indicator of mood. Scowling or scrunched faces indicate anger while raised eyebrows often indicate contentedness or relaxation. Note if they have an accent, a high or low speaking voice, if they seem excited or frustrated, or if they are overly quiet. Make guesses as to how they are feeling based on how they sound and if they are enjoying their conversations. It can also be fun to overhear snippets of people’s conversations without context.\\nA:'},\n",

About half of all Christians worldwide are Catholic, while more than a third are Protestant (37%). Orthodox communions comprise 12% of the world\\'s Christians. Other Christian groups make up the remainder. Christians make up the majority of the population in 158 countries and territories. 280 million Christian live as a minority.\\n\\nQuestion: Christians are the majority in how many countries and territories in the world today?\\nAns: 158\\n\\n\\nArticle: Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed \"real ale\" by the CAMRA organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a \"stillage\" which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between 11–13 °C or 52–55 °F), before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to \"drop\" (clear) again, as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being \"gravity-fed\" directly into the glass.\\n\\nQuestion: What would you call a beer that has not been filtered or pasteurized?\\nAns: Cask-conditioned ales\\n\\n\\nArticle: In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States. This included children who rolled cigarettes, engaged in factory work, worked as bobbin doffers in textile mills, worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries. Lewis Hine\\'s photographs of child labourers in the 1910s powerfully evoked the plight of working children in the American south. Hines took these photographs between 1908 and 1917 as the staff photographer for the National Child Labor Committee.\\n\\nQuestion: What year were over 2 million children employed in the US?\\nAns: 1910\\n\\n\\nArticle: Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century.\\n\\nQuestion: How was the Latin language brought to Britain?\\nAns:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Question:\\nQueens of the Stone Age are an American rock band formed in 1996 in Palm Desert, California. The band\\'s line-up includes founder Josh Homme (lead vocals, guitar, piano), alongside band members Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboard, percussion, backing vocals), Michael Shuman (bass guitar, keyboard, backing vocals), Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, percussion, backing vocals), and Jon Theodore (drums, percussion). Formed after the dissolution of Homme\\'s previous band, Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy rock music. Their sound has since evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences, including working with ZZ Top member Billy Gibbons, Nirvana drummer and Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, and Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan who has been a steady contributor to the band.\\nAfter the breakup of his previous band, Kyuss, in 1995, Josh Homme briefly joined Screaming Trees as a touring guitarist, before deciding to form a new band, Gamma Ray. In 1996 they released the eponymous Gamma Ray EP, featuring \"Born to Hula\" and \"If Only Everything\" (which would later appear on their self-titled debut as \\'If Only\\'). The EP featured Matt Cameron of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, Van Conner from Screaming Trees, and percussionist Victor Indrizzo.  Gamma Ray changed their name in 1997 after the German power metal band Gamma Ray threatened to sue. The name \"Queens of the Stone Age\" came from a nickname given to Kyuss by their producer Chris Goss. Homme said of the name: \"Kings would be too macho. The Kings of the Stone Age wear armor and have axes and wrestle. The Queens of the Stone Age hang out with the Kings of the Stone Age\\'s girlfriends when they wrestle ... Rock should be heavy enough for the boys and sweet enough for the girls. That way everyone\\'s happy and it\\'s more of a party. Kings of the Stone Age is too lopsided.\"  The first release under the Queens of the Stone Age name was the song \"18 A.D.,\" released on the compilation album Burn One Up! Music for Stoners which featured members of the Dutch stoner rock band Beaver. The band\\'s first live appearance was on November 20, 1997, at OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington, with Cameron on drums, Mike Johnson of Dinosaur Jr. on bass and John McBain of Monster Magnet on guitar. In December that year, the band released a split EP, Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age, which featured three tracks from the Gamma Ray sessions as well as three Kyuss tracks recorded in 1995 prior to their breakup.  Queens of the Stone Age released their self-titled debut in 1998 on Stone Gossard\\'s and Regan Hagar\\'s label Loosegroove Records, and on vinyl by Man\\'s Ruin Records. Homme played guitar and bass on the album (the latter credited to Homme\\'s alter-ego Carlo Von Sexron), Alfredo Hernandez on the drums, and several other contributions by Chris Goss and Hutch. Homme reportedly asked Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan to appear on the record, but he was unable due to other commitments.  Soon after the recording sessions were finished for the album, former Kyuss bassist Nick Oliveri joined the group, and touring commenced with a band consisting entirely of ex-Kyuss members. Guitarist Dave Catching joined shortly after. From this point forward, the band\\'s line-up would change frequently; by the time their second album was being recorded, Hernandez had left the group to play in other bands.\\nAnswer this question using a quote from the text above:\\n\\nwhere did they tour to?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nMichael Anthony Sobolewski (born June 20, 1954 and legally shortened his name to Michael Anthony in 1978), is an American musician who is currently the bass player in the rock supergroup Chickenfoot and the Circle. Anthony is best known as the former bass player for the hard rock band Van Halen. Anthony is known for his stage antics, his effects-laden live solos, his number of custom-made bass guitars, including a Jack Daniel\\'s model shaped like a whiskey bottle, and his background vocals in Van Halen. He also has a signature Schecter Guitar Research bass-guitar series.\\nWhile Anthony was a promising catcher in baseball, he also competed on the Dana Junior High School track team (long jump) and played in the marching band there from 1967-1969. He took an interest in guitar as a teenager, but picked up the bass instead since most of his other friends already played guitar or drums. Anthony\\'s friend Mike Hershey gave him a Fender Mustang electric guitar that Anthony converted by removing the two highest strings and playing it as a bass guitar. Eventually, his father bought him a Victoria copy of a Fender Precision Bass and a Gibson amplifier. Anthony mostly modelled his bass playing after Jack Bruce of Cream, but also admired Led Zeppelin\\'s John Paul Jones and Harvey Brooks of Electric Flag. His first band was called Poverty\\'s Children. Other bands he played in included Black Opal, Balls, and Snake. Although Anthony is naturally left-handed, he plays right-handed.  Snake, a three-piece group featuring Anthony on lead vocals and bass guitar, was the last band in which Anthony played before joining Van Halen. Snake played covers of ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Foghat, along with some original songs. They played several of the same types of gigs as did the Van Halen brothers\\' band Mammoth. Snake even once opened for Mammoth at a show at Pasadena High School. Mammoth\\'s PA failed that night, so Anthony lent them Snake\\'s PA.  While attending Pasadena City College, Anthony pursued a degree in music. Eddie Van Halen also took classes there and they would often see each other on campus. During this time, bass player Mark Stone parted ways with Mammoth and the Van Halens decided to audition Anthony as a replacement. Anthony was impressed by their skill during subsequent jam sessions even though he had seen the brothers play before. After the session, the Van Halen brothers asked Anthony to join their band. One story claims that he said he had to think about it and consulted Snake guitarist Tony Caggiano who advised Anthony to join Van Halen. However, according to Michael Anthony\\'s web site, when asked if he wanted to join Mammoth, Anthony immediately said yes. This has become the accepted version of events.\\nAnswer this question using a quote from the text above:\\n\\nwhere did he learn how to be a bass player?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n'},\n",

It is evidence of the horrific deaths dolphins suffer at their hands that Japanese fishermen have tried to keep secret for years. An activist has succeeded in filming the barbaric slaughter using ‘spinal spikes’ – and the footage is now set to ignite international outrage. It was shot in a cove during the notorious Taiji ‘drive-hunts’ and shows a fisherman repeatedly stabbing a metal rod into the base of a dolphin’s head behind its blowhole. Another man then rams a wooden plug hard into the wound to prevent the sea turning red with blood, thus\\xa0 alerting marine conservationists. Grim: This picture shows evidence of the horrific deaths dolphins suffer at the hands of Japanese fishermen. This  undercover footage shows a fisherman repeatedly ramming a metal rod into the base of the dolphin's head. The Japanese Fishing Ministry has maintained for more than a decade that this method is more humane than killing dolphins using traditional spears and clubs. However, the fishermen have been obsessed with ensuring the slaughter takes place out of sight.Before driving the animals into the shallows of a chosen cove, they erect elaborate scaffolding on surrounding cliffs and hang tarpaulins to shield their activities. But one intrepid conservationist managed to find a vantage point to capture the barbaric reality of the slaughter. He hid a remote camera in the cliffs long before the ‘curtain of\\xa0 horror’ was erected and managed to film a killing at close quarters. Upset: Protestor Hannah Fraser, left, and American actress Hayden Panettiere take part in a protest against the slaughter of dolphins by Japanese fishermen. The dolphin slaughter at Taiji was first exposed in the Oscar-winning 2009 film The Cove, and it has long been seen by marine conservationists as an exercise in mass cruelty. However, The Cove was unable to gain footage as useful to conservationists as this current video and many of the film’s more gruesome scenes were cut out for fear they were too upsetting for audiences. A spokesman for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society said the new video provided the first footage of dolphin spike killings at such close proximity. It has enabled a senior British veterinary scientist to write a devastating report on the slaughter in which he says the animals suffer a ‘profoundly distressing, traumatic and painful’ death. Study leader Dr Andrew Butterworth believes the spinal puncture actually prolongs their suffering to an unimaginable four minutes or more. Dr Butterworth, of the University of Bristol Veterinary School, concludes: ‘This killing method does not conform to the recognised requirement for “immediate insensibility” and would not be tolerated or permitted in any regulated slaughterhouse process in the developed world.’ A WDC spokesman said of the film: ‘This is what has allowed a proper scientific assessment. It is the first time this killing method has been independently analysed.’ It is the scientific analysis of the\\xa0 footage which, the WDC believes, puts mounting pressure on Japan to ban the method. Since uploading the images along with an online petition to its website last week, the WDC has recorded more than 100,000 hits. Among those re-tweeting the link are comedian Stephen Fry, who urges his followers: ‘Help stop the horror behind the killing of dolphins in Taiji. Check out the shocking footage. Sign the petition.’ Horrific: Whales are pictured being killed nearby in Taiji , Wakayama. Louie Psihoyos, director of The Cove, which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2010, told The Mail on Sunday that he cut out much of his own covert footage of the slaughter. He said: ‘What we showed in The Cove, no matter how difficult that was for people to watch, was still a Disney version of what actually happens. ‘Having seen first-hand how the Taiji dolphin-hunters treat dolphins while the world is not watching, and having viewed more than\\xa0 40 hours of covert footage which my team filmed under the secrecy of their tarpaulins, I can safely\\xa0 say that there is nothing remotely humane about the way in which they kill these creatures with their spinal spikes. ‘If we showed the world what actually went on there … nobody should have to suffer through watching that. ‘These creatures, with bigger brains than us, are sometimes tied up by their tail for hours before they are spiked, geysers of blood spraying with every heartbeat. It sometimes goes on for minutes until they are drained of blood. ‘They thrash and bleed while their mates swim through the blood to try to rescue them.’The WDC’s campaigns manager Courtney Vail said scientific analysis of the latest footage had ‘confirmed our worst fears’. Awful: This shows a scene from the documentary The Cove (2009) which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2010. It highlighted the slaughter of dolphins. She added: ‘It verifies the unspeakable cruelty taking place behind the tarpaulins.’ Dr Butterworth said fisherman began using the spinal puncture method 13 years ago after two\\xa0 Japanese scientists claimed it ‘reduced time to death’. However, the covert video, which was neither dubbed nor cut, shows a dolphin still alive four minutes and 14 seconds after the first rod is plunged repeatedly into his back. Animal welfare groups estimate that around 900 dolphins were killed at Taiji during the eight-month season. All will be sold for their meat. Matt Brash, president of the British Veterinary Zoological Society, said at least dolphins were killed comparatively quickly when using traditional hunting practices of clubbing and spearing. ‘This method supposedly severs the spinal cord – assuming the fisherman manages it,’ he said. ‘That will stop the dolphins swimming away but then they’re just going to bleed to death and drown. ‘I can see there’s going to be less blood about because the fishermen are plugging the holes. But that’s just a cosmetic way of concealing an atrocious and unacceptable act. Dolphins are beautiful, intelligent and sentient animals and they will know what is happening.’\\n\\nInput: Bangkok has highest number of Britons requiring Foreign Office help, much\\xa0concerns medical issues.

       "    'content': \"It's worth preparing for the worst of you are travelling to Bangkok as the Thai capital has the highest number of cases where the British Consulate has stepped in to help out Britons in trouble. In research released by the Foreign Office for 2014, Bangkok emerged as the destination where most Britons found themselves in trouble on holiday, with the need for medical advice and attention the biggest reason. Paris and Malaga followed Bangkok in the list, but both had almost a quarter of cases compared to that of the the Far Eastern city, where there were around 8,000 cases of Britons requiring overseas help. Scroll down for video. A total of 84,000 British citizens required help from the Consulate last year around the world, ranging from medical and illness assistance, to help with arrests and lost property. The report looked at each month of 2014, dissecting what cases were looked at where British government assistance was required. As far as drug arrests were concerned, Spanish party-city Malaga topped the pile on the highest number of Britons requiring assistance with drug-related offences, with around 50 cases recorded. Bangkok was again up there with around 33 cases, followed by the city of love Paris and Mexico  recording 33 cases apiece. Bangkok has the highest number of Britons requiring British Consulate help in the world, with most concerning receiving adequate medical treatment. The summer season sees a dramatic increase in the number of drug-related offences - in July alone 150 Britons were arrested around the world adding more work for the foreign office. Poor hygiene in Thailand contributes to Bangkok being ahead of everywhere else when it comes to cases of Britons needing hospital attention. And of course, with the language barrier often leading to confusion, it's little surprise the British Consulate is called upon to mediate and ensure the right treatments are given. Those countries that have a buzzing nightlife and club scene were also unsurprisingly high in the list where hospital treatment was required. Malaga again made the top five, alongside Tenerife, Palma and Alicante. Numbers lower than five in the research were averaged between one and five, and so given as three for reporting purposes. The clubbing scene appears to be linked to drug arrests, with more Britons arrested for these offences in Malaga than anywhere else. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told MailOnline Travel: 'In light of the risk of unprovoked attacks you should be cautious and take care, especially at night. 'Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Some British nationals in Thailand have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, resulting in some suicides. 'Be aware of the possibility of credit card fraud. Don’t lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming in Thailand. Where possible use an ATM within a bank and always protect your PIN. 'Be careful to observe demarcation lines between shops and stalls, particularly in market areas and at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Taking items from one shop’s area to another may be treated as suspected theft. 'Be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers. Foreigners have had items snatched by thieves on motorbikes when walking along busy streets or travelling in open transport like tuk tuks. If you travel by bus, make sure cash and valuables you have are kept securely. There have been incidents where passengers have had items taken from bags while asleep. 'Gem scams are common. There have been reports of visitors buying gems for inflated prices from seemingly respectable establishments then later finding out the stones are worth a tiny fraction of the purchase price. 'You should report any incidents of crime to the Thai police before leaving the country.'

I can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous, provocative and important, yet failed so consistently across the board. It is like a stand up comic who\\'s not getting laughs, but can\\'t leave the stage. The harder the film tries, the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud. The desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved.\\n\\nThe film achieves laugh-out-loud status only twice. Once is in the sight of Geraldo Rivera playing an obnoxious, arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist -- which is funny only because he apparently doesn\\'t realize he is playing himself. The other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film\\'s final \"big moment,\" wherein the judge played by Morgan Freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is (\"it\\'s what your mama taught ya!\"). The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. \\n\\nYet, one must admit it is a noble effort. It does have a good, if poorly cast, band of actors, who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures. The film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves are apparent, if not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics, never arises above the level of cartoon. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even sitcom requires timing. But the best Bonfires can muster is desperation.

What a great comic talent that woman had, seeing The Girl From Missouri is a sad reminder of the great loss the world of film sustained with her passing three years later.\\n\\nIronically enough the casting of Patsy Kelly with Harlow was no doubt influenced by the successful shorts Kelly was making with another famous platinum blonde, Thelma Todd.

Rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element.\\n\\nRukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names \"Radium X\". Due to Rukh\\'s long absences, his comely young wife Diana (Frances Drake) becomes attracted to Drake and the two fall in love. Meanwhile Rukh becomes contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.\\n\\nRukh goes to Benet for help. Benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. Unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects Rukh\\'s brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.\\n\\nWhile Rukh is continuing his work, Sir Frances takes news of the discovery back to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. When he returns to France he learns of the healing power of Radium X as he cures his mother\\'s (Violet Kemble Cooper) blindness and of Benet\\'s work in curing the maladies of his patients.\\n\\nBut Rukh\\'s madness intensifies.

       "    'content': 'Problem: Background: Joshua Daniel White (February 11, 1914 - September 5, 1969) was an American singer, guitarist, songwriter, actor and civil rights activist. He also recorded under the names Pinewood Tom and Tippy Barton in the 1930s. White grew up in the South during the 1920s and 1930s. He became a prominent race records artist, with a prolific output of recordings in genres including Piedmont blues, country blues, gospel music, and social protest songs.\\nContext: White was in many senses a trailblazer: popular country bluesman in the early 1930s, responsible for introducing a mass white audience to folk-blues in the 1940s, and the first black singer-guitarist to star in Hollywood films and on Broadway. On one hand he was famous for his civil rights songs, which made him a favorite of the Roosevelts, and on the other he was known for his sexy stage persona (a first for a black male artist).  He was the first black singer to give a White House command performance (1941), to perform in previously segregated hotels (1942), to get a million-selling record (\"One Meatball\", 1944), and the first to make a solo concert tour of America (1945). He was also the first folk and blues artist to perform in a nightclub, the first to tour internationally, and (along with Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie) the first to be honored with a US postage stamp.  White and Libby Holman became the first mixed-race male and female artists to perform together, record together and tour together in previously segregated venues across the United States. They continued performing off and on for the next six years, while making an album and a film together.  White was seen as an influence on hundreds of artists of diverse musical styles, including: Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Oscar Brand, Ed McCurdy, Lonnie Donegan, Alexis Korner, Cy Coleman, Elvis Presley, Merle Travis, Joel Grey, Bob Gibson, Dave Van Ronk, Phish, Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, Shel Silverstein, John Fahey, Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul and Mary, Judy Collins, Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, Mike Bloomfield, Danny Kalb, Ry Cooder, John Fogerty, Don McLean, Robert Plant and Eva Cassidy; in addition to those African-American artists, such as Blind Boy Fuller, Robert Johnson, Brownie McGhee, Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, Pearl Primus, Josephine Premice, Eartha Kitt, Harry Belafonte, Odetta, Ray Charles, Josh White, Jr., Jackie Washington, the Chambers Brothers, and Richie Havens, who in the footsteps of White were also able to break considerable barriers that had hampered African-American artists in the past.\\nQuestion: What was he\\nAnswer: first black singer to give a White House\\n\\nProblem: Background: Portugal. The Man is an American rock band from Wasilla, Alaska, currently residing in Portland, Oregon. The group consists of lead singer John Baldwin Gourley, Gourley\\'s partner & back-up singer Zoe Manville, Zach Carothers, Kyle O\\'Quin, Jason Sechrist and Eric Howk. Gourley and Carothers met and began playing music together in 2001 at Wasilla High School in Wasilla.\\nContext: In November 2014, Portugal. The Man were in the studio recording their eighth album with Mike D from The Beastie Boys producing. The band also actively updated their Instagram account with pictures of them in the studio with Mike D, as well as showcasing small teasers of what their new album would sound like. Mac Miller was also shown working with the band as well. The first week of May, 2015, the band released teasers on social networks of what appeared to be new music with a Latin twist with huapango guitars, dream synths and drums machines. On May 5, Portugal. The Man released a Spanish version of \"Purple Yellow Red and Blue\" covered by a Mexican-American band called The Chamanas on their official YouTube channel to celebrate the Mexican festivities (Cinco de Mayo). On December 31, 2015, Portugal. The Man posted to their website that they had completed two records followed by separate hashtags #Gloomin + #Doomin. However, on February 3, 2016, the band tweeted from their official account that the new record would be entitled Gloomin + Doomin. In February 2016 Portugal. the Man were featured on the Yoko Ono collaboration album Yes, I\\'m A Witch Too performing \"Soul Got Out of the Box\".  On November 30, 2016, Triple J radio debuted Portugal. The Man\\'s new song \"Noise Pollution\". It was released as a single, \"Noise Pollution [Version A, Vocal Up Mix 1.3]\", on December 2, and featured Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Zoe Manville. On March 3, 2017, the band released a single titled \"Feel It Still\", which was followed by the release of an accompanying music video three days later. It was revealed that Gloomin + Doomin \"failed to complete\" and was thrown out after three years. They have since completed another album, titled Woodstock, which is promoted by \"Feel It Still\". The album\\'s title was inspired by an original 1969 Woodstock music festival ticket stub owned by Gourley\\'s father. It led Gourley to a realization that almost 50 years later, music has the same mission as then - \"to comment on societal and political unease.\" \"We worked with so many rad people on this album, but ended up with just the four of us in a basement at 4 a.m. trying to say something that mattered,\" said Gourley. \"Trying to write music that would help people feel they\\'re not alone, even if they\\'re angry or feeling lost.\" Woodstock was released on June 16, 2017. John Gourley and Zoe Manville married on New Year\\'s Eve 2017.  \"Feel It Still\" became the band\\'s biggest hit single to date in the United States, reaching #1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs, Hot 100 Airplay, and Pop Songs charts and becoming a Top 5 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. On January 28, 2018, \"Feel It Still\" won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. The band also won the ASCAP Vanguard music award at the pop awards March 2018.  \"Live In The Moment\" became a #1 track on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart during the week of March 26, 2018. It additionally gained the honor of the track with the most spins (plays) during a week\\'s time, that has ever been recorded on Alternative radio at 3,503.\\nQuestion: What happened in 2014?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"The ruling monarch of the mind.\" Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York\\'s Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration. Einstein next traveled to California where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate, Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \"awkward\", as Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism,\" where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech\\'s students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good. This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein\\'s outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament,\" from which came his \"extraordinary intellectual energy.\" Chaplin also remembers Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his theory of relativity. During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food. She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and started playing. He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour, then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa bringing up his food. At the end of the two weeks he came downstairs with two sheets of paper bearing his theory. Chaplin\\'s film, City Lights, was to premier a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. \\n\"What were the events preceding Einstein\\'s seclusion?\" is \"Ignored his food\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\nOutput: yes\\n\\n\\nInput: Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar\\'s parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership.

Sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester. The penchant for slapstick spoilt \\'The Three Musketeers\\' for me and the same applies here. To me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed. I rejoiced, as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. How I would have loved to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books (too scrawny looking! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell. Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of \\'Flash For Freedom\\', adapted by Mr Fraser, worked quite well. Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen.\\n\\n\\nProblem: Write a positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) movie review.\\n\\nAnswer: I\\'m giving it only 9 out of 10, because I need to view it again, in a more current mind-frame to have a fresh perspective.

How to lose friends and Alienate people is probably the funniest film of 2008, and I think you definitely should see it. As I said earlier, the film has a fantastic cast including: Kirsten Dunst(Spider-Man, The Virgin Suicides) Danny Huston(The Number 23, 30 days of night) Gillian Anderson(The X-Files) Megan Fox(Transformers, Confessions of a teenage drama Queen) Jeff Bridges(The Big Lebowski, The Vanishing) Overall, How to lose friends and Alienate people is hilarious. I think Simon Pegg and Kirsten Dunst do work well together, and I think you should see it. Though there is some odd nudity including Trans-sexuals, it\\'s a hilarious and awesome comedy. One of Simon Pegg\\'s best.\\n\\nThe Plot:Sidney Young, a journalist from England, travels down to New York to work at Sharp magazines. While there, he meets an actress named Sophie Maes and tries to sleep with her before his boss does.'}]},\n",

       "    'content': 'Many Conservative Republicans Believe Climate Change Is a Real Threat\\n\\nWASHINGTON — A majority of Republicans — including 54 percent of self-described conservative Republicans — believe the world’s climate is changing and that mankind plays some role in the change, according to a new survey conducted by three prominent Republican pollsters.\\n\\nThe results echo a number of other recent surveys concluding that despite the talk of many of the party’s candidates, a significant number of Republicans and independent voters are inclined to support candidates who would back some form of climate action. It may also point to a problem facing Republicans seeking their party’s presidential nomination: The activists who crowd town hall meetings and Republican presidential caucuses and primaries might not reflect the broader attitude of even the Republican electorate.\\n\\nThe survey was commissioned by Jay Faison, a North Carolina businessman who calls himself a conservative Republican and has announced that he intends to spend $10 million on efforts to lobby Republicans to embrace the issue of climate change. He has spent $165 million to start a nonprofit foundation, ClearPath, aimed at promoting climate change and clean energy policies that could appeal to conservatives.\\n\\nIn an interview Monday, Mr. Faison said he has recently spoken by phone to “most” of the Republican candidates, as they have sought his financial contributions to their campaigns.\\n\\n“There’s a shortlist of guys who can give at that level, and I’m on it,” he said.\\n\\nMr. Faison hired three prominent Republican pollsters to conduct the survey: Whit Ayres, who works for the presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida; Glen Bolger, a three-time winner of the American Association of Political Consultants’ “Republican Pollster of the Year;” and Kristen Soltis Anderson, author of “The Selfie Vote: Where Millennials are Leading America (And How Republicans Can Keep Up).”\\n\\n“At the moment some of the louder voices in the party are dominating this debate,” said Ms. Anderson in an interview. “But as we move out of the entertainment phase of the campaign and look at more of the policy platforms, there’s a way for Republicans to talk about this that depoliticizes climate.”\\n\\nOn the campaign trail, the leading Republican presidential contenders question or deny human-caused climate change. In an interview on CNN last week, Donald J. Trump said, “I don’t believe in climate change.” In an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle this month, Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who, along with Mr. Trump, is at the top of many recent polls said, “There is no overwhelming science that the things that are going on are man-caused and not naturally caused.”\\n\\nWhile such statements sit well with many conservative activists, the new survey found that 73 percent of all voters and 56 percent of Republicans do believe the climate is changing. Fewer than a third of Republicans think the climate is changing because of purely natural cycles, and only 9 percent think the climate is not changing at all, the survey found. It also found that 72 percent of Republicans support accelerating the development of renewable energy sources.\\n\\nDemocrats, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, have sought to paint Republicans who question climate change as deniers of science who are out of touch with the mainstream.\\n\\nMr. Faison and the Republican pollsters said that in order to avoid that characterization, Republicans need to move beyond questioning and start offering solutions.\\n\\nAt the same time, President Obama’s regulatory efforts to curb climate change have put pressure on Republican presidential candidates to speak out in opposition. Mr. Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency regulations are aimed at pollution from coal-fired power plants. Republican leaders, including all the leading presidential candidates, have criticized the rules as job-killing government overreach.\\n\\nMs. Anderson described the survey as a way to find a path for Republican candidates to straddle the line between denying climate science and rejecting Mr. Obama’s policy.\\n\\nThe survey asked respondents to react to a series of proposed policy solutions to climate change, ranging from E.P.A. regulations to the imposition of a carbon pollution tax on electric utilities, which would then be rebated to consumers.\\n\\nOnly 10 percent of Republicans said they would support E.P.A. regulations — which are designed to cut the use of fossil fuels as a source of electricity, and greatly ramp up the use of wind and solar power. But 83 percent of Republicans said the nation should ramp up the use of such energy sources.\\n\\nAnd while Mr. Obama’s efforts to push some form of price on carbon pollution failed in Congress, the Republicans’ survey found that 54 percent of conservative Republicans would support a carbon tax if the money were rebated, and 54 percent supported a five-year tax credit to promote renewable energy.\\n\\nConservative organizations, backed by strenuous opponents, say the policies remain political liabilities.\\n\\n“In a Republican primary, or frankly in a general election, to enact the policy agenda of the global warming movement is a political loser,” said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group funded by Charles G. and David H. Koch. “If a candidate came out in favor of a carbon tax — that is clearly a political loser,” he said.\\n\\nAmong the policies that won the greatest support were those that would promote installation of rooftop solar panels. Eighty-seven percent of conservative Republicans supported such policies, if they would allow homeowners to save money by selling electricity back to the power company. Sixty-six percent of conservative Republicans said they would support policies that would require electric utilities to include renewable power in their generation mix.\\n\\nsummary: Echoing a number of other recent surveys, a significant number of Republicans believe the climate is changing and mankind plays a role in that change.\\n\\n\\nWhy better US growth may not boost commodities\\n\\nHe expects commodity prices to come under pressure in 2014 as emerging market industrial production growth slows.\\n\\n\"The combination of increased supply for many commodities, as well as continued structurally weaker emerging market growth (we expect China to slow back toward 7 percent) is likely to cause many prices to continue to stagnate through 2014, with those commodities experiencing a long-awaited increase in supply coming under the most pressure,\" he said.\\n\\nCredit Suisse expects prices of iron ore, copper and gold to fall substantially, while tin, thermal coal, U.K. and U.K. natural gas, Brent oil and silver will remain flat.\\n\\n(Read more: Why I just turned bearish on natural gas: Pro)\\n\\nAnother factor which may keep commodity prices in check is U.S. dollar strength.\\n\\nEarly next year, \"quantitative easing will be reduced in some form. That means the easy money that has flown to the rest of the world will, in some form, go back to the U.S.,\" Laxminarayan said. \"That will provide some strength for the U.S.dollar. If I look out three to five years from now, we are in a very structurally strong U.S. dollar market.\"\\n\\n— By CNBC\\'s Leslie Shaffer. Follow her on Twitter: @LeslieShaffer1\\n\\nsummary:'},\n",

And in Mitzpe Hila, Israel, they gave a hero\\'s welcome for the young soldier who last saw his hometown five years ago. \\n\\nThe release of Israeli soldier Gildad Shalit in exchange for the eventual release of 1,027 Palestinians held by Israel unleashed a powerful wave of celebration among Palestinians and Israelis alike. \\n\\nIt also raised the ire of some Israelis, who worry the deal would lead to more violence. \\n\\nIn Mitzpe Hila, onlookers waved Israeli flags, danced, cheered and tossed white roses at a convoy carrying the young soldier home. He emerged from a white van and briefly acknowledged the crowd with a wave before uniformed officers hustled him away, apparently into his parents\\' home. \\n\\nAt the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza, masked Hamas gunmen accompanied buses filled with released prisoners to a terminal where they met with friends and relatives for emotional reunions before a mass celebration and parade in Gaza City. \\n\\nSome of them chanted, \"We want another Shalit,\" CNN\\'s Matthew Chance reported. \\n\\nCrowds of Palestinians flooded the streets of Gaza, waving flags and banners to welcome the released prisoners home.

When the Spanish explorers reached this area they found their descendants, Suma and Manso tribes. In the southern part of the state, in a region known as Aridoamerica, Chichimeca people survived by hunting, gathering, and farming between AD 300 and 1300. The Chichimeca are the ancestors of the Tepehuan people. \\n\\nDuring the Napoleonic Occupation of Spain, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest of progressive ideas, declared Mexican independence in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato on September 16, 1810 with a proclamation known as the \"Grito de Dolores\". Hidalgo built a large support among intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people. Hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population. He started on a march to the capital, Mexico City, but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal government from Guadalajara, Jalisco but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city. Hidalgo attempted to reach the United States and gain American support for Mexican independence. HIdalgo reached Saltillo, Coahuila where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by Viceroy Francisco Venegas in return for Hidalgo\\'s surrender. A short time later, he and his supporters were captured by royalist Ignacio Elizondo at the Wells of Baján (Norias de Baján) on March 21, 1811 and taken to the city of Chihuahua. Hidalgo forced the Bishop of Valladolid, Manuel Abad y Queipo, to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on September 24, 1810. Later, the Inquisition issued an excommunication edict on October 13, 1810 condemning Miguel Hidalgo as a seditionary, apostate, and heretic.\\n1. Who was the progressive Catholic?\\n2.

I  would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined  below:  IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business  unit heads receiving this message. Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan,  would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June  8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m. Even if you have already had an opportunity to  visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of  us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time. Please  contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour. New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted. Any change requests that have already been received are currently being  considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head. If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August  3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their  name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date. Example:  Bob Smith NH  7/25 Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed  by Cathy Phillips. Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related  issues. Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for  the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well  informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise. Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we  will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near  future. A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building. The  Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only. Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent  phone (with the existing phone numbers). Please contact Jennifer Burns if  you have any questions or issues related to phones. All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and  there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or  people. On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space  available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow  later): 1 Mega conference room 1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities 1 Large conference room - no videoconference  3 Team rooms File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will  be made for each group. Every attempt is being made to have the assigned  file space as close to each individual group as possible. At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not  been resolved. Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues  will be appreciated. It is highly probable that food service in the new  building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move  date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries  and distribution. Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would  appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to  them via e-mail. They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday  at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions. Please make  arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues. There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the  new building. I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of  questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great  and everything will work out in time. Thank you for your cooperation and  assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as  possible.

After Campbell spun the note to Confederate legislators as a possible end to the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln rescinded his offer and ordered General Weitzel to prevent the Confederate state legislature from meeting. Union forces killed, wounded or captured 8000 Confederate troops at Saylor\\'s Creek southwest of Petersburg on April 6. General Lee continued to reject General Grant\\'s surrender suggestion until Sheridan\\'s infantry and cavalry appeared in front of his retreating army on April 8. He surrendered his remaining approximately 10000 troops at Appomattox Court House the following morning. Jefferson Davis retreated to North Carolina, then further south. when Lincoln rejected the surrender terms negotiated by general Sherman and envoys of North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which failed to mention slavery.

There was much discussion of whether the air moved in quickly enough as the plates were separated, or, as Walter Burley postulated, whether a \\'celestial agent\\' prevented the vacuum arising. The commonly held view that nature abhorred a vacuum was called horror vacui. Speculation that even God could not create a vacuum if he wanted to was shut down[clarification needed] by the 1277 Paris condemnations of Bishop Etienne Tempier, which required there to be no restrictions on the powers of God, which led to the conclusion that God could create a vacuum if he so wished.

With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927.

We called ahead of time to ask if they have food there which all they have is vending machines so we came prepared packing lunches for all of us to eat.  You now enter at the side where you used to enter near the library and there was a room with a tv where the homeless were.  Before we never got bothered by them but at least we don\\'t have to deal with it just in case.  The first exhibit we encountered was the Smokey the Bear with an employee interacting with our kids with animal puppets and then marching around with those puppets pretending they were the animal.  The kids LOVED this.  I loved the different elements in this room which was all about the outdoors from safety of fires, camping, the stars etc.  There are so many rooms to explore with different activities.  We loved the big bubbles you can make or attempt to.  The kids got to be inside a big bubble and an employee made a really large bubble which brought smiles to all the kids faces.  Then the music area with dress up clothes and a stage.  The kids enjoyed pretending they were performing for us.  As we walked out to get our lunches we walked past some cool drums like what they use for Blue Man Group!  Gotta take my daughter to see that Group.  After seeing the smurfs my daughter loves Blue!  Just teasing.  We ended upstairs learning about nutrition, excercising and checking our heart rate.  We ended with making sand art which was an additional fee of only $3.00 then to the art room where we (us adults too) learned to trace and transfer then color a piece we chose.  Even though mine didn\\'t personally look like Wonder Women I think for being in my 40\\'s I might change careers and get into Art.  Not!  But kinda impressed. We had a great time here!  Please Please bring snacks and water.  If you forgot you may deal with a broken vending machine like I noticed when we came here.\\n\\n\\nQ: negative\\n\\nA: I\\'ll start by saying... The concept is great.  Execution is a completely different story.  We were excited about the menu and ordered quite an array of items. We ordered a burger and truffle fries, Greek pizza, ahi sirachi taco, hot-mame, and strawberry lemonade.  Let\\'s start by saying I understand that this is a new place... Get it. I understand that they didn\\'t anticipate such traffic... Get it.  So.... The key is to make your guest who will be visibly irritated at the chaos & lack of uniformity feel important and happy. That\\'s not happening. The employees are just as confused as the people arriving!!! We walked in never having been here. WE see that it\\'s crowded... Assume we have to wait, which is fine. The guy at the front wants to tell me about the menu.... I\\'m not dense or stupid.... Ill figure the menu out. What I would like you to do is answer how I\\'m to proceed with my 2 year old son and 1 year old nephew and two other members of my party. He tells me there is no list to put our names down on and it\\'s first come first serve. The problem with that idea is that there was already a line out the door and people standing around waiting for tables...... Let\\'s put it this way, it\\'s just a shit fest. The Blind leading the blind.  Yeah you can take it to go..... BUT GO WHERE?!?? The place is on a desolate road near the strip.  They get a two because the food was good.  The other three stars they can get if I ever decide to come back to this place after they work the kinks out and get their shit together.....oh & after I visit every other restaurant that we\\'d like to in Vegas..... You know... Where they have seats and a staff. Not just food and a register.   The highlight was the strawberry lemonade... Which for the other two people with me was horrible, for me was great bc it wasn\\'t sweet and literally tasted like strawberry, lemon, and water.   **side note: while there they asked a couple to move to the bar bc they were taking up seats at a table for a bigger party...... And people were at the ALREADY busy register asking for boxes and trying to correct wrong orders. ...... A MESS!\\n\\n\\nProblem: What would be an example of an positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) review?\\n\\nAnswer: This place is inside the 99 Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.  When you walk in, make a right and keep going. Make sure you don\\'t go to the \"combo plate\" steam table area -- Taiwan Express is in the corner.   You order at the counter and wait about five minutes. The chicken pancake is a psychoactive delight. Also try the whole fish (a special once or twice a week for five bucks!) and the boba teas.\\n\\n\\nInput: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive.\\nGenerate a negative review for a place\\nOutput: I\\'ve been to this restaurant twice now, both times came away disappointed. Ordered a chicken sandwich the first time, it was the worst chicken sandwich I\\'ve ever had, and the service was extremely slow. Gave the place a second chance tonight, thinking that the first time was an anomaly, but my Hawaiian Calzone was barely luke warm, and consisted mostly of bread and pizza sauce, hardly any ham or pineapple. And, the service was extremely slow again. My daughter\\'s chicken sandwich was just a chicken strip with some pizza sauce on a large hoagie role. She the chicken off the role and ate it by itself. We ordered an appetizer and they didn\\'t bring it until they brought the main meals. I don\\'t usually take the time to write reviews, but I just felt compelled to warn people to not go here, especially if they want to get in and out in less than two hours.\\n\\n\\ninput: Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\noutput: Horrible service for gross overpriced food.

       "    'content': 'Porscheâ\\x80\\x99s secret stash\\nCrouched down behind the car you see above, I\\'m stumped. I have the nagging feeling I\\'ve seen this clip somewhere before, but right now I can\\'t place it.\\n\\nIt\\'s not a regular car part, though. Ah, got it, it\\'s the front clamp from an old wire ski binding - don\\'t ask me how I know this, but I\\'m fairly sure no one else here can identify it.\\n\\n\"Do you know what this is?\" comes a voice at my shoulder. I stand up, ready to reveal my disturbingly in-depth knowledge of ancient ski equipment, but before I can fix my features to smug, he continues, \"It\\'s from an old ski binding. The engineers were having difficulty holding the engine cover of the 910 down safely, and, over dinner one night, Mr Piëch spoke about this to his good friend Mr Geze, whose firm made these bindings, and this was the solution.\"\\n\\nDieter Landenberger is manager of Porsche\\'s archives and a man who probably knows more about Porsche\\'s history and heritage than the Porsche family themselves. This is fortuitous, as I\\'m currently in a warehouse containing many curious Porsches, most of which I\\'m struggling to identify. There is a reason I\\'m here. Porsche has a museum (if you haven\\'t been and happen to find yourself in Stuttgart, go. It\\'s amazing. Especially the escalator) but the 80 cars there are just the tip of a 500-strong iceberg. All of which have to be stored somewhere.\\n\\nThis is the somewhere. It\\'s not far from the museum, just another industrial building in an industrial corner of an industrial city. It used to house a production line, but will soon store an entire back catalogue of automotive greatness (and not-so-greatness). I say soon because the ink on the lease is still wet. That\\'s right, TopGear is here to help Porsche move its family jewels into a new home. Let\\'s hope its insurance policy is up to date.\\n\\nBig shiny trucks arrive, doors are opened, glimpses of cars appear and ramps are lowered. A man jumps on to a bright red Porsche tractor of considerable vintage and concours condition. There\\'s a typically agricultural noise accompanied by a localised and particularly noxious fog cloud. When it clears, the tractor is revealed to be towing a totally see-through Cayenne Hybrid out from the transporter\\'s interior. If Porsche were really concerned about CO2 emissions, this would surely be happening the other way round...\\n\\nI lend a hand and loosen the ratchet strap on a Type 597 Jagdwagen military jeep. It lurches backwards, at which point some German expletives occur and I realise that old cars don\\'t necessarily have effective handbrakes. Nor are they in perfect nick. Some are decidedly moth-eaten in fact, like the battered 906 that seems to have crashed headlong through each and every one of the 46 intervening years.\\n\\nIt looks properly battle scarred, all peeling bonnet badge, shagged upholstery and rotting composite panels. It\\'s possibly my favourite car in the whole place, a story behind each ding and wrinkle. Dieter looks it over sympathetically and says: \"It would be a shame to over-restore this car, we want to keep the authenticity of these cars alive. That, for us, is a big challenge.\"\\n\\nI\\'m glad to hear him say it. Glad, too, that most of these cars are in less than pristine condition. The majority smell musty inside, dust is evident, they look like they\\'ve lived a bit. Or at least been in storage for a while. They jar with the polished floor and fresh paint that\\'s been daubed around here. But this facility is evidence of how seriously Porsche takes its back catalogue. This, surprisingly, is a relatively recent phenomenon. The firm only started keeping the first and last cars from each production run a few years back. It\\'s now making up for lost time by going on the open market and buying important cars back. It recently got hold of a 993 Cabrio. From Julio Iglesias. Yeah.\\nPlease write a summary below.\\nOne-off concepts and little-seen models are found inside the Porsche Museumâ\\x80\\x99s shiny new storage facility.\\nBorder Fence Called Impractical\\nBuilding a fence in an attempt to secure the U.S. border with Mexico is impractical and would simply lead illegal immigrants to cross elsewhere, according to former U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and other experts.\\n\\nAnd the Mexican government agreed in a diplomatic note sent yesterday to the U.S. government, warning that the fence would damage relations between the two countries.\\n\\nThe Senate voted Friday to build about 700 miles of double-layered fence with access roads, lighting, cameras and sensors, to try to block five heavily used crossing points along the 2,000-mile border.\\n\\nThe plan, which awaits President Bush\\'s signature, includes a sweep of fencing along most of the Arizona border, where about half of the almost 1.2 million people arrested crossing from Mexico last year were caught.\\n\\nThe fence would also stretch through parts of California, New Mexico and Texas.\\n\\nFormer U.S. customs agents who have hunted drug traffickers in the mountains and deserts near the Arizona border said the new barrier would be defeated by the rugged terrain.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t build a wall across the mountains of southern Arizona, as much of the terrain is inaccessible even on foot,\" veteran agent Lee Morgan said as he stood along the proposed route of the fence, east of Douglas.\\n\\nThe barrier would have to traverse the rugged Huachuca Mountains and other craggy ranges west of Nogales, Ariz., which are marked by bluffs and ravines that make them inaccessible to vehicle traffic, Morgan noted.\\n\\nAnother former customs special agent said the fencing would also struggle to bridge hundreds of creek beds spanning the Arizona-Sonora border, which are prone to flash floods from May to October.\\n\\nRepublican backers of the proposal contend it is necessary to prevent entry to the United States by illegal immigrants and extremists, and to prevent smuggling of weapons and drugs.\\n\\nMexican President Vicente Fox, who leaves office Dec. 1, has called the barrier \"shameful\" and compared it to the Berlin Wall. His spokesman yesterday urged Bush to veto the bill.\\n\\n\"This decision hurts bilateral relations, goes against the spirit of cooperation needed to guarantee security on the common border, creates a climate of tension in border communities,\" Ruben Aguilar told reporters.\\nPlease write a summary below.\\n'},\n",

Xbox Live Free is included with all SKUs of the console. It allows users to create a user profile, join on message boards, and access Microsoft\\'s Xbox Live Arcade and Marketplace and talk to other members.

African goods stopped being imported into Europe, first disappearing from the interior and by the 7th century found only in a few cities such as Rome or Naples. By the end of the 7th century, under the impact of the Muslim conquests, African products were no longer found in Western Europe. The replacement of goods from long-range trade with local products was a trend throughout the old Roman lands that happened in the Early Middle Ages. This was especially marked in the lands that did not lie on the Mediterranean, such as northern Gaul or Britain. Non-local goods appearing in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods. In the northern parts of Europe, not only were the trade networks local, but the goods carried were simple, with little pottery or other complex products. Around the Mediterranean, pottery remained prevalent and appears to have been traded over medium-range networks, not just produced locally.\\nWhat event led to African goods no longer being traded in Western Europe by the end of the 7th century?\\nAnswer: Muslim conquests\\nContext and question: On 20 June 1995, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to adopt a resolution renouncing its racist roots and apologizing for its past defense of slavery.

But the flip side of that increase is that non-video content produced by some of the leading publishers is getting less and less interaction.\\n\\nThat’s according to a recent study published by NewsWhip, an analytics company that focuses on content distributed by social networks. When it comes to Facebook, the agency tracks liking and sharing activity across the platform, and it says the data shows a “noticeable decline in engagement” with media content over the past few months.\\n\\nNewsWhip said it looked at likes, comments and sharing of linked articles from the top 10 publishers on Facebook over the past year. That group includes both digital natives such as BuzzFeed and Huffington Post as well traditional media outlets such as the New York Times, Fox News, the BBC and the Guardian, and some smaller outlets.\\n\\nOver the past nine months, NewsWhip says, the research shows a fairly sharp decline in engagement of all kinds: Likes, the most dominant form of interaction, dropped by about 55% between July of last year and April of 2016. And sharing activity also declined sharply: Shares fell by 57% and comments by almost 64%.\\n\\nGet Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.\\n\\nIt seems obvious that engagement for non-video content is declining. But why? It could be that Facebook is deliberately pushing that kind of article down in people’s feeds. Or it could be a consequence of Facebook promoting more video, which squeezes out other forms of content. Or it could be both.\\n\\nWhatever the cause, the impact of Facebook promoting video and paying media companies to produce it is obvious: According to NewsWhip, CNN had 1,051 posts on its main Facebook page last July, with 22 native videos and a total of 97,330 engagements overall. Last month, however, the news network had about the same number of posts, but there were 10 times as many videos — 22% of the total — and 2 million engagements.\\n\\nAs the NewsWhip blog points out, in addition to the focus on video, Facebook has made a number of tweaks to its news-feed algorithm that have also affected how media content appears and whether it gets engagement or not. Among the changes were that Facebook now pays attention to “time spent” with an article in addition to just sharing behavior.\\n\\nFacebook also said that it was trying to promote original content over content that has shown up a lot in people’s feeds already, and that may have helped push down the numbers for media companies as well. But the biggest factor of all seems to be Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s relentless focus on video. That appears to be shaping the behavior of news consumers on the platform more than some publishers might like.\\n\\nWrite a one or two sentence summary.\\n\\nSummary:'},\n",

Speaking ahead of talks with David Cameron at Chequers, Mr Karzai declined to comment in detail about the Prince’s controversial claims, but said: ‘He’s a young man, and young men do make mistakes talking.’ Mr Karzai also provocatively claimed that life in Afghanistan’s notorious Helmand province was better, and safer, before British troops arrived in 2006. Scroll down for video. David Cameron hailed today's deal with Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan (left) and Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari (right) at a summit at Chequers. The three men agreed that peace talks to secure the future of Afghanistan had to involve the Taliban. Prince Harry, 28, spoke last month about his 20-week posting as an Apache helicopter gunner in Afghanistan. ‘Take a life to save a life, that’s. what we revolve around,’ he said. ‘If there’s people trying to do bad. stuff to our guys, then we’ll take them out of the game.’ His comments caused controversy here. and angered some in Afghanistan. Mr Karzai, a friend of Prince Charles,. yesterday made clear his disapproval, but stressed the matter should go. no further. The three leaders said that ¿significant progress¿ had been made since they last met in September. The trilateral meeting, held at the Prime Minister's official country retreat, was the third such meeting in less than a year. He said: ‘Prince Harry is a young man, we do give exits to young men when they make mistakes.’ Mr Karzai described the growing spate. of insider attacks on Western forces by members of Afghanistan’s. security forces as a ‘serious breach of hospitality’. He insisted that Helmand province was better off before British troops arrived in 2006. Prince Harry talked about 'taking out' Taliban insurgents during his tour of duty in Afghanistan. ‘In 2002 through to 2006, Afghanistan. had a lot better security. When we had our own presence there, with very. little foreign troops, schools were open in Helmand and life was more. secure.’ But he insisted he did not want to. ‘blame’ Britain for making the situation worst – and insisted that. Afghans ‘appreciate the sacrifices of the British forces’. Mr Karzai. said it was unclear whether Britain and the US, which will withdraw. combat troops next year, were leaving because they thought they had. achieved their mission in weakening Al Qaeda or because they had. realised they were ‘fighting in the wrong place in the first place, so. they should discontinue doing that and leave’. His comments are likely to cause. controversy in the UK, which has spent more than £17billion on the. Afghan conflict and lost 440 soldiers. Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former. Army officer, said: ‘This message will hit the many bereaved families in. this country very hard. I hope that President Karzai is sincere when he. says he appreciated the sacrifice our young men and women have made.’ President Karzai’s comments came ahead. of talks at Chequers with Mr Cameron and Pakistan’s president Asif Ali. Zardari on the future of Afghanistan. Mr Cameron is trying to broker a. security deal between the two countries to be in place before Western. combat troops leave Afghanistan in 2014. Islamist extremists are. threatening both countries. He urged them to encourage moderate elements of the Taliban to join peace talks. Mr Zardari (left) peace in Pakistan depended on peace in Afghanistan, adding: 'We feel that we can only survive together' Mr Cameron said the three countries agreed that Afghanistan must never  become a 'haven for terrorism' The summit included senior political, military and intelligence figures from the three countries, including Mr Cameron, Mr Karzai, British Foreign Secretary William Hague, national security advisor Kim Darroch, the UK Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards, and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers. The leaders called on the Taliban to open an office and to enter into dialogue to secure long-term peace in Afghanistan. Further talks are expected to take place later this year, as British and US troops prepare to leave Afghanistan.\\n\\nWhat are highlight points?\\nAnswer:\"},\n",

The bun, lightly toasted breast of an angel resting gently on the sassy and BBQ sauces below. Flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux. And then, an onion! The most playful little onion, caramelized and flavorful. Then a slice of cheddar, lettuce, tomato and a patty of ground beef so exquisite. Swirling in your mouth breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweet and savory so delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread, Robin. This is God, speaking to us through food. --Marshall from HIMYM (kind of).  Walking in to Hopdoddy, it was clear this was no ordinary burger joint.  It's a hip, modern building with a bar in the middle and tables all around, including a lovely patio.  At first we were confused, but luckily the Burger Bouncer to the rescue!  He explained the process, handed us a menu, a table number, and sent us to the line.  By the time we reached the front we had decided...we both chose the Goodnight Burger, mine without the jalape\\\\u00f1o.  We ordered a small order of fries on the side to share, a fountain drink, handed over our table number, and paid there at the counter.  The fountain drinks...a selection of main root sodas in various flavors; some familiar, some new.  I saw bright drinks on other tables in pink, green and blue.  I chose the mexicans cola and was quite pleased.  For my water-drinking fianc\\\\u00e9, there was carbon filtered water though I'm not sure what that means.  Right behind that were two disposal cans, one for recyclables and one for compost.  I'm not sure if the general public is able to discern compostables (saw someone putting the dredges of a milkshake in there) but I appreciate the effort!  Finally, the service was impeccable.  Everyone we encountered was super friendly and personable.  The team here works like a well-oiled machine, using teamwork and efficiency to keep everyone happy without missing a beat.    My only regret is that this restaurant is pretty far.  It will certainly be on my mind when we are in the neighborhood though.  The cocktail menu looked awfully intriguing!\"}]},\n",

       "    'content': \"Question:\\nComing off of their bye week, the Steelers traveled to East Rutherford, NJ to take on the Jets.  The Jets scored first in the first quarter when Nick Folk scored a 25-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead for the only score of that period.  The Steelers managed to tie it at first in the 2nd quarter followed by taking the lead with 2 other field goals as Suisham kicked field goals from 46, 33, and 48 yards out for scores of 3-3, 6-3, and 9-3 respectively.  The Jets tried to rally as Folk nailed a 39-yard field goal for a 9-6 score at halftime.  In the 2nd half, it was all Steleers as they pulled away when Ben Roethlisberger found Emmanuel Sanders on a 55-yard touchdown pass for a 16-6 lead in the 3rd quarter which was then followed up by Suisham's 32-yard field goal in the 4th quarter for a final score of 19-6.\\n\\nWho threw the longest touchdown?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nBen Roethlisberger\\n\\n\\nquestion: Hoping to snap a six-game losing streak, the Chargers flew to EverBank Field for a Week 13 Monday night duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  San Diego delivered the game's opening punch with a 13-yard touchdown run from running back Mike Tolbert, followed by a 29-yard field goal from kicker Nick Novak.  The Jaguars would answer in the second quarter with quarterback Blaine Gabbert completing a 9-yard touchdown pass to running back Maurice Jones-Drew and a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cecil Shorts, yet the Chargers replied with quarterback Philip Rivers connecting with rookie wide receiver Vincent Brown on a 22-yard touchdown pass and a 35-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Vincent Jackson. San Diego added onto its lead in the third quarter with Rivers hooking up with wide receiver Malcom Floyd on a 52-yard touchdown pass.  Afterwards, the 'Bolts would pull away in the fourth quarter with a 31-yard touchdown run from running back Ryan Matthews.\\nAnswer this question: How many total yards were scored on touchdowns measuring longer than 30 yards long?\\nanswer: 118\\n\\n\\nIn the early game the Giants were crushed by the Rams 31–3, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38–7, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, making them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17–14 against the defending conference champion 1970 Minnesota Vikings season, thus setting up a matchup against the 1970 Dallas Cowboys season for the NFC championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing, 17–10, thus giving the Cowboys their first conference championship. The 49ers sent five players to the 1970 Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington (49ers), and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.\\n\\nHow many points did the 49ers win their divisional playoff game by?\\nA: 3\\n\\n\\nQ: The Bengals entered their week eleven matchup with the Kansas City Chiefs sporting a 4-5 record coming off an upset victory over reigning the Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants. The Chiefs began the scoring in the game, completing an eight play, fifty-nine yard drive with a thirty-four yard Ryan Succop field goal following three-and-outs by both teams one their respective first possessions of the football game. From there however, the momentum swung heavily in the favour of the Bengals, who would reel off the next twenty-one consecutive points. The Bengals began their run by completing an eleven play, seventy-eight yard drive with a four-yard touchdown pass from sophomore quarterback Andy Dalton, to fellow sophomore receiver AJ Green. The drive, highlighted by two different successful fourth down conversions by the Bengals offensive unit, was seen as a catalyst for the momentum swing that took place by Cincinnati running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis. The touchdown marked the ninth straight game with a receiving score for the second year receiver out of the University of Georgia. The streak, the current longest in the National Football League, also broke the Cincinnati Bengals single-season franchise record for consecutive games with a receiving touchdown.After the teams traded two possessions each that resulted in points for neither team, Cincinnati manifested a five play, fifty-seven yard drive. The drive appeared to culminate on a ten-yard throw from Andy Dalton to third-year tight end Jermaine Gresham, out of the University of Oklahoma. However, upon booth review, Gresham was deemed to have been tackled just within the 1-yard line. Dalton would run the ball in one play later, on a bootleg run to make the score 14-3 in favour of Cincinnati. Following another Kansas City punt, the Bengals continued their onslaught, as their offense engineered an eleven play, seventy-nine yard drive highlighted by runs of twenty-one and seventeen yards respectively by running backs BenJarvus Green-Ellis and Cedric Peerman. The drive was capped off by a one-yard touchdown scamper by Green-Ellis, putting the Bengals ahead by a commanding 21-3 score. Just before the half time break, Kansas City showed signs of life, completing several medium-range passes during a quick seven play, sixty-five yard drive. Place kicker Ryan Succop would be successful on his second attempt of the afternoon, nailing the thirty-three yard field goal, bringing the Chiefs to within a score of 21-6 at half time. After each team was unsuccessful on their respective two possessions in the third quarter of play, Cincinnati would score the final points of the football game on the opening possession of the fourth quarter. Andy Dalton finished off the Bengals twelve play, seventy-two yard drive by hitting rookie receiver Mohamed Sanu, out of Rutgers. The touchdown gave the Bengals a 28-6 advantage which would end up being the final score on the day.With the victory, the Bengals evened their record at 5-5 on the season, pulling to within one game of both the Indianapolis Colts and the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Wildcard playoff race.\\nWhat was the Bengals record after winning this game?\\n\\nA: 5-5\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nThe 49ers played their second game of the season against the St. Louis Rams on September 17 in a Week 2 home - opener. After a loss to the Arizona Cardinals the previous week, the 49ers redeemed themselves with a win at home. Second year quarterback Alex Smith threw for 233 yards with 11 completions and one touchdown pass to Antonio Bryant. Bryant had four receptions with 131 yards. Running back Frank Gore ran for a (at the time) career-best 127 yards with a touchdown, despite Jonas Jennings and Larry Allen being sidelined with injuries. San Francisco won 20-13 and evened out their record at 1-1.\\n\\nWho did the 49ers play the week prior to playing the Rams?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\"},\n",

Curiosity may have killed the cat but it caused just a little bit of embarrassment for this inquisitive cow. The animal got its head stuck in a tree in the middle of a field in Monkmoor, Shropshire, yesterday afternoon. It took a team of six firefighters from Shropshire Fire and Rescue an hour-and-a-half to free the young bullock. Trapped: The bullock with its head stuck in the tree in the field in Shrewsbury. It later had to be rescued by the fire brigade using a specialist animal harness. Emergency workers initially tried to free the. animal using strops but were forced to admit defeat and use a harness. and a crane instead. Pictures taken at the scene show the team of firemen gathering around the hapless cow with specialist animal rescue equipment. After being winched up and released. from the tree, the animal was said to be distressed but uninjured and. was later reunited with it's herd in a nearby field. Neil Grove, Shrewsbury station manager for Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'It was a very strange incident indeed. Rescue mission: Five firefighters surround the bullock as it is fitted with the specialist harness and attacked to a crane. The bullock was later lifted up and released from the tree distressed but uninjured. 'What he was looking for, I don’t know. and we don’t know how long he was in there. Manual lifting didn’t work. because of the way his head was trapped. 'It's normal to cover animals’ heads. during rescues to keep them in the dark for as long as possible -. because this helps them to stay calm. 'But on this occasion, with the cow’s. head in the tree it was not really necessary. His head was in the bottom. of the tree which was quite dark. 'He was relatively calm while we were. there. The cow ran off once we got him out – he didn’t stay around to. thank us. He was bemused but appeared uninjured.' A spokesman for Shropshire Fire and. Rescue Service added: 'On arrival the officer in charge. assessed the situation and attempts were made initially to release the. animal using strops and various equipment from the Shrewsbury. appliance. 'These attempts proved unsuccessful,. so a specialist large animal harness, with a quick release mechanism,. was used in conjunction with the Hiab crane on the rescue tender. 'The cow was successfully lifted up and released from the tree.'\\nout: The animal was rescued from a field in Monkmoor in Shropshire. It took a team of six firemen an hour-and-a-half to free the young bullock.\\nQuestion: Winston Churchill urged the United States to launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union to win the Cold War, a newly released document reveals. The previously unseen memorandum from the FBI archives details how Britain’s wartime leader made his views known to a visiting American politician in 1947. Churchill believed a pre-emptive strike on Stalin’s Russia might be the only way to stop Communism conquering the West. Russian leader Joseph Stalin (left) and Winston Churchill (right) in 1945 - he urged the US to launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union to win the Cold War. The note, written by an FBI agent, reports that Churchill urged Right-wing Republican Senator Styles Bridges to persuade President Harry Truman to launch a nuclear attack which would ‘wipe out’ the Kremlin and make the Soviet Union a ‘very easy problem’ to deal with. The Russians would have been defenceless against a nuclear attack at that time – they did not successfully test their own atomic bomb until 1949. Britain and the Soviet Union had been allies in the Second World War until 1945, the year Churchill lost office as Prime Minister. But he was one of the first international statesmen to recognise the post-war threat posed by the USSR, and in 1946 made a famous speech in Fulton, Missouri, about an ‘iron curtain’ having descended across Europe as Joseph Stalin consolidated his grip on the eastern half of the continent. The FBI document shows Churchill’s belligerence towards Britain’s former wartime ally ran so deep that he was prepared to tolerate the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians in a nuclear strike. Churchill believed a pre-emptive strike on Stalin’s Russia might be the only way to stop Communism conquering the West. The memo claims Churchill ‘stated that the only salvation for the civilisation of the world would be if the President of the United States would declare Russia to be imperilling world peace and attack Russia’. The note continues: ‘He pointed out that if an atomic bomb could be dropped on the Kremlin, wiping it out, it would be a very easy problem to handle the balance of Russia, which would be without direction. ‘Churchill further stated that if this was not done, Russia will attack the United States in the next two or three years when she gets the atomic bomb and civilisation will be wiped out or set back many years.’ The memo is published for the first time in a book called When Lions Roar: The Churchills And The Kennedys, by award-winning investigative journalist Thomas Maier. It is due to be published in Britain next month. John F. Kennedy regarded Churchill as his hero and made him an honorary American citizen in 1963 – the first person to be given such an accolade. The two families shared friends, such as Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who married Jacqueline Kennedy after her husband’s assassination. Maier said: ‘Churchill had been a great historian of warfare. He saw the last great cavalry charge during the First World War and championed the development of tanks. ‘I think he saw a nuclear strike as just another progression of conventional warfare, until he realised there was a lot more devastation with nuclear weapons.’ Maier said Churchill was more ‘bellicose’ when out of office. After he returned to power in 1951, a nuclear attack against the USSR was never mentioned again.\\nWhat are the important parts of this article?\\nImportant parts:\"},\n",

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President\\'s reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \"that\\'s all we know right now, Mr. President.\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules. \\n\\nQuestion: \"How much time had elapsed between American 11 hitting the World Trade Centre and the senior NMCC operations officer reaching out to the FAA operations center for information?\"\\n\\nAnswer: \"46 miutes\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\nAnswer: no\\n\\nProblem: The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake.

The scene that he had just witnessed affected him strangely; it stirred once more within him all of his old ambition, all of his old enthusiasm, and yet neither found voice in words. He was glad when the dinner was over at Thorne\\'s, and with the going of the mail sledge and the senior engineer there came over him a still deeper sense of joy. Now _he_ was in charge, it was _his_ road from that hour on. He crushed MacDonald\\'s hand in a grip that meant more than words when they parted. In his own cabin he threw off his coat and hat, lighted his pipe, and tried to realize just what this all meant for him. He was in charge--in charge of the greatest railroad building job on earth--_he_, Jack Howland, who less than twenty years ago was a barefooted, half-starved urchin peddling papers in the streets where he was now famous! And now what was this black thing that had come up to threaten his chances just as he had about won his great fight? He clenched his hands as he thought again of what had already happened--the cowardly attempt on his life, the warnings, and his blood boiled to fever heat. That night--after he had seen Meleese--he would know what to do. But he would not be driven away, as Gregson and Thorne had been driven.

       "    'content': \"The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces. This gives them a huge amount of stored energy. This type of energy is called nuclear energy. This energy can be released and used to do work. This happens in nuclear power plants where they split apart the nucleus of an atom. This splitting apart is called nuclear fission. Another type of nuclear energy happens in the Sun. Here the atoms nuclei are not split apart. Instead, the nuclei of the atoms are fused, or joined together. This process is called nuclear fusion. Some of the suns energy travels to Earth. This energy from nuclear fusion warms the planet and provides the energy for photosynthesis. \\nWhat question would one ask from this paragraph?\\nAnswer: What are the two nuclear processes called?\\n\\nTuesday, September 11, 2001, dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States. Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes. It would be their final conversation. \\nWhat question would one ask from this paragraph?\\nAnswer: What were the targets of their attack?\\n\\nSometimes traits can vary from parent to offspring. These changes are due to mutations. Mutations are a random change. Mutations are natural. Some mutations are harmful. In this case, the organism may not live to reproduce. The trait will not be passed onto offspring. Others variations in traits have no effect on survival. Can some mutations be good for a living thing? Other mutations can have great benefits. Imagine being the first moth that can blend into its background. It would have a better chance of survival. A living thing that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the new trait on to its offspring. Thats good news for the offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive. Mutations are one way living things adapt to new conditions. \\nWhat question would one ask from this paragraph?\\nAnswer: Are mutations good or bad?\\n\\nAlthough  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. \\nWhat question would one ask from this paragraph?\\nAnswer:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Input: Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to $10 from $5 and in circuit court to $20 from $10. Kentucky\\'s current fee for filing a case in district court is $50.50, and in circuit court $108. The increase still would leave Kentucky\\'s filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about $1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he\\'s concerned because federal funding hasn\\'t increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. \\'\\'If you don\\'t come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,\\'\\' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren\\'t popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. \\'\\'A lot of poor people are not going to get served,\\'\\' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association\\'s board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid \\'\\'has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,\\'\\' Catron said. \\'\\'We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.\\'\\' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. \\'\\'It would really offset the current cuts,\\'\\' he said. \\n\\nDoes the response \"Gevden\" correctly answer the question \"Who said legal services will go away if funding is not increase?\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput: yes\\n\\n\\n We were cornered in a sort of way already.

I had the moral advantage of a mad bull in a street.  But for all that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them.  Very probably there was.  Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears.  It might be they had other surprises for us....

       "    'content': 'Input: Australian pair of Fitzgibbon and Tesch guaranteed sailing gold on final day. Paralympic Basketball medalist Tesch only took up sailing two years ago. Quadriplegic sailor Fitzgibbon uses technology to be able to compete.\\nOutput: One was a quadriplegic who controlled the steering with his breath, the other a former wheelchair basketball Paralympian who took up sailing only two years ago. But together they secured the first Paralympic sailing gold medal at London 2012, and all with one race to spare. Wednesday saw the Australian pair of Daniel Fitzgibbon and Liesl Tesch clinch victory in the two-person keelboat class, as they built an unassailable lead going into today\\'s final day of racing. The medal continued Australia\\'s blistering form in sailing at the London games. In July they won four golds, topping the medal table. But this gold could be their most impressive yet, exhibiting not just great sailing prowess, but the latest in Paralympic technology -- enabling those with the most severe disabilities to compete at the highest level. Paralympics sailor: \\'My disability is a gift\\' Fitzgibbon only has limited movement in his arms and none in his legs after breaking his back falling off a jetty when he was 21 years old. But technology has allowed him to compete at this year\\'s games, helping him to steer his specially adapted boat. \"As part of Paralympic sailing an important aspect is the seating ... so we worked hard on that and we have some nifty systems in it,\" he explained to the Australian press before leaving for London. One of those \"nifty systems\" is the sip and puff system that allows him greater control steering his boat by blowing or sucking into a specially adapted straw that then interprets his signals. \"(With my hands) all I have to do is push and pull, just like a tractor, it\\'s made out of light weight carbon fiber too ... My hands are strapped in so I need to find a way of controlling (the boat) so we came up with this sip and puff system.\" Technological breakthrough. Yet sailing at the Paralympics is still a relatively new phenomenon. The sport was only introduced at the Sydney games in 2000 after a successful trial at Atlanta four years previously. More than 80 sailors have taken part in over six days of competition, in three separate classes culminating in today\\'s final crucial races. But, perhaps inevitably, Paralympic sailing is a complicated sport to both compete in and to judge. Both men and women sail in the same classes but are classified by the severity of their disability -- an issue that has caused many controversies both at this Paralympics and in disabled sport in general. A score of one is given to most severely disabled, seven for the least. \"We have classifiers who are physios and doctors, but they know all about the rules of sailing,\" explained Linda Merkle, president of the International Association for Disabled Sailors. \"When we selected the particular boat (class to be raced at the Paralympics) we said that one should be female and the other male and that one has to be a class one or two disability, like being a quadrapligic. The more severely disabled sailor tends to be on the helm.\" But it has been the technological advances in recent years that have allowed the more severely disabled sailors compete. \"It is the adaptations (to the boat) that allow them to compete and have an even level,\" says Merkle. \"With the sonar (boats), disabled sailors are not able to get from one side to the other. So now there\\'s a transferring seat -- a \\'traveler\\' -- so the sailor can now move more freely. The adaptations have really allowed them to compete, and compete in able-bodied sailing too.\" The freedom of the sea. The final day of competition is likely to be the most watched event in Paralympic sailing history. Only a handful of nations compete and Merkle wants to capitalize on the sport\\'s growing success. \"We also include people with visual impairments and we are now folding blind sailing into the sport,\" Merkle said. \"We are growing and we do have a development segment of our organization to help countries to move in and spread the word.\" That should not be too difficult to achieve. After all, disabled sailing is an easier sell than many sports given that it has one huge advantage over the others: the freedom of the sea. \"That\\'s the beauty of sailing,\" says Merkle. \"You feel free. And when you come to the Paralympic sailing you can\\'t see what the disabilities are. \"It gives you freedom and the ability to compete.\" Follow the final day\\'s Paralympic sailing action on our live blog -- as the Australians compete with Germany, France and the USA for the top spot.\\n\\nInput: Eugenie Bouchard knocked out of WTA Rogers Cup by Shelby Rogers. Bouchard goes down 6-0 2-6 6-0 in front of home crowd at Montreal. The Canadian was playing her first match since her Wimbledon final defeat.\\nOutput: It was supposed to be something of a homecoming for Eugenie Bouchard, but the 20-year-old\\'s return to Montreal for the WTA Rogers Cup only ended in disappointment. The Canadian has so far enjoyed a season to remember, making the last four at both the Australian and French Opens, before reaching a maiden grand slam final at Wimbledon in July, losing out to Petra Kvitova. Yet the world No. 8 was unable to replicate that success in front of an expectant home crowd Tuesday in a second-round clash against American qualifier Shelby Rogers. Playing for the first time since her defeat at the All England Lawn Tennis Club, Bouchard found herself on the losing end once again, going down 6-0 2-6 6-0. Rogers -- a runner-up at the WTA event in Bad Gastein, Austria last month -- surprised her opponent, and the crowd, by storming towards the first set, producing seven winners along the way. And the 21-year-old then showed her nerve to take the third in style after Bouchard had earlier threatened to rein her back in by securing the second. \"This was my first experience in an atmosphere like this -- the whole stadium cheering for one person,\" Rogers, the world No. 113, is quoted as saying by the WTA\\'s official website. \"I really respect what [Bouchard\\'s] done. It\\'s incredible to see how much support she has.\" Bouchard, meanwhile, was disappointed to lose a match in her hometown, but took some satisfaction from the way she performed in the second set. \"I think I was feeling the pressure a little bit on the court -- I felt a little match rusty, kind of,\" she is quoted as saying by the WTA\\'s official website. \"But I knew coming into the match that I can\\'t use those as excuses. \"I knew it would be kind of a difficult situation. But I\\'m happy I was able to at least prove to myself that I could turn things around and not let the match run away from me completely. That\\'s definitely a positive from the match.\" The Canadian added on her opponent: \"She was solid the whole match -- she never really sprayed too many balls, and she was always there. Whenever I let up a little bit, which I think I did in the third, she was all over it.\" Elsewhere, in the men\\'s edition of the Rogers Cup -- taking place in Toronto -- Roger Federer needed just 52 minutes to advance to the third round of the competition Tuesday. The second seed, playing in his first match since his final defeat to Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon last month, eased past Canada\\'s Peter Polansky 6-2 6-0.\\n\\nInput: Watergate figure Chuck Colson became a born-again Christian, founded prison ministry. William Bennett says Colson fought tirelessly for the forgotten and condemned. Colson\\'s mission was to address the root causes of social problems, Bennett writes. Colson lamented the breakdown of family, lack of mentors for young people, he says.\\nOutput:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Chuck Colson was a man in full. The former White House special counsel and Watergate accomplice turned born-again Christian and prison evangelist, reminded us all, through his muscular Christianity and ever-present Marine training, that every life is worth saving, that no man should be left behind. He fought tirelessly on behalf of the forgotten and condemned. He defended the defenseless. In his passing on April 21 at the age of 80, we remember one of America\\'s premier cultural ambassadors. Through his Prison Fellowship ministry, Angel Tree program, weekly radio broadcasts, books, and sermons, Colson touched countless lives, from the most innocent to those on death row. He pleaded guilty in 1974 to obstruction of justice in the Nixon White House Watergate scandal and served seven months in prison. But before he went to prison, he underwent a dramatic conversion and became a born-again Christian. Colson emerged from prison a man forever transformed. Last year, on one of his final public speaking tours, Colson summarized his ongoing mission for the past 40 years -- addressing the root causes of the cultural problems threatening our society. \"I discovered early on that the reasons the prisons were being filled wasn\\'t all the sociological theories about crime that we hear generally, it was the... lack of moral training during the morally formative years,\" Colson explained. \"We are raising a generation that lacks male role models. The family has broken down. These kids aren\\'t learning character.\" Colson understood that the family is the knot that holds the fabric of civilization together. If the family unravels, then so does society -- economically, socially, and morally. And now, it appears we may be headed that way. Today, more than half of births to American women under 30 happen outside marriage. The out-of-wedlock birth rate in the United States has passed 40% and more than 70% of all births to black women are outside marriage. Children today are the product of fewer successful marriages than perhaps ever before. With high unemployment rates, children are increasingly less likely to see a father or mother getting up and going to work in the morning. Less than half of the American population attends church on a weekly basis. The founding virtues that made this country so successful -- hard work, fidelity and faith -- are in diminishing supply. These virtues can\\'t be taught in ethics classes or pop culture movies, but rather, they must be learned through example, particularly that of mentors and role models. Our children, boys in particular, are drawn to the strongest and loudest forces around them. If positive influences, like parents, teachers, and coaches, are missing, children will gravitate to something inferior, like drugs or gangs. Colson would often illustrate this with stories of convicts leaving prison only to be handed $100 by the guards and told, \"See you again in a couple weeks.\" For the overwhelming majority, it was true. They returned home to the same gang they left, the same crimes they committed before, and they ended up back in prison again several weeks later. Colson understood the solution to these problems wasn\\'t political or economical, but cultural. On March 30, Colson gave a speech at the Wilberforce Weekend Conference in northern Virginia. It was the last public speech he would ever give. In it he remarked, \"Politics is nothing but an expression of culture ... so if things are bad, don\\'t think it\\'s going to be solved by an election. It\\'s going to be solved by us.\" All great change starts from the bottom up -- from the dinner table to the football field to the prisons. If you want less poverty, less crime and less social breakdown, you need stronger families, stronger churches, and stronger communities. Chuck Colson dedicated himself to this cause with unparalleled fervor and compassion. He will be sorely missed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.'}]},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: It was a typical November day in 1971 when an eighth-grader left her house in a sleepy New Hampshire town with her pet dog, Tasha, in tow. Kathy Gloddy was found murdered a mile from where she was last seen. The German shepherd returned home that day without its 13-year-old master, Kathy Gloddy. To her family\\'s horror, the little girl\\'s body was found the next day, three miles from her home. She had been beaten, raped, strangled and run over by a car repeatedly until she was dead. Her body was found clothed only in her kneesocks. At the time, police had several possible suspects, but not enough evidence for an arrest, said Sgt. Scott Gilbert of the New Hampshire State Police. In 2006, Gilbert said, Kathy\\'s body was exhumed in search of further clues, but authorities were unable to obtain forensics from the remains. Kathy\\'s family asked private investigator Tom Shamshak to aid in the investigation and he agreed to volunteer his services. So far, investigators have only been able to piece together a timeline of the day Kathy went missing.  Watch an update on the case ». It is believed that she left her family\\'s home at 5 p.m. to go to a convenience store, where she bought ice cream and potato sticks. Soon after leaving the store, she was spotted at Franklin High School, where one of her older sisters was attending a banquet. It is unclear where Kathy went next, but what is known is that later that evening her dog returned home acting frantic and anxious, family members said. \"When Tasha came home without Kathy, we were worried,\" said Kathy\\'s sister, Janet Young. \"And then the dog was running around in circles, acting crazy and pawing at the door as if looking for Kathy. We always came home when we said we would and never stayed out late worrying our parents.\" Private investigator Shamshak said he believes the killer may not have been a stranger. \"This kind of brutality and rage-driven crime can only come from someone that knew her or her family,\" he said. Jim Conrad, a former New Hampshire State Police trooper who worked on the case, said Kathy was found in the woods not far from a small gravel road near a popular swimming hole in Franklin, New Hampshire. Investigators believe the area -- which is only one mile from where she was last seen at the high school -- was merely a dumping site for the body and not the actual crime scene. \"One of the things my team is working on is trying to get the post-mortem DNA evidence collected by the forensic pathologist who examined her,\" Shamshak said. While there is not a lot of evidence left, it is the one piece of evidence the family hopes could link potential suspects to Kathy\\'s murder. \"We have waited so long for justice and closure,\" said Karen Beaudin, another of Kathy\\'s sisters. Gilbert said there are at least two persons of interest authorities have focused on and both were acquainted with Kathy Gloddy and her family. Gilbert said police thought they\\'d caught a break in 2004 when convicted sex offender Edward Dukette, who served time in a Florida prison for raping and nearly killing a young girl, unexpectedly came forward to police claiming he had key information about Kathy Gloddy\\'s murder. Dukette was a former neighbor of the Gloddys and had been evicted from the multiple-family dwelling eight months before Kathy\\'s murder. Gilbert was one of several investigators who traveled to Florida to question Dukette, but the potential suspect recanted his earlier statements and refused to speak further with officials. The Gloddy family and Tom Shamshak have said they believe there is more than one person responsible for Kathy Gloddy\\'s murder. The family is organizing a reward fund in conjunction with the Carole Sund Foundation. Anyone who has information that could lead to the arrest of the individuals responsible for Kathy Lynn Gloddy\\'s murder is asked to call the New Hampshire State Police Crime Unit tip line at 603-271-3636.\\nSummarize this article.\\n\\nAnswer: Teen girl found wearing only socks after being raped, murdered. Kathy Gloddy left home with her pet dog, who returned without her hours later. Police have few clues and at least two persons of interest. A former neighbor came forward claiming information, but later recanted.\\nProblem: Bad teacher:\\xa0Michelle Ladd, 41, a married teacher from Indiana, has been charged with having sexual relationships with two 17-year-old students. A 41-year-old teacher from Indiana has been charged with having sex with two 17-year-old students and giving them thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts, including alcohol, guns and cars. Michelle Ladd, of Miami County, was arrested Monday on charges of child seduction, unlawful transfer of a handgun and providing alcohol to a minor. Investigators with the Miami County Sheriff\\'s Office say the instructional assistant with the Maconaquah School Corporation\\'s alternative program started a relationship with one of her students in 2010 after she and her husband hired the 17-year-old to work on their farm to earn some extra cash. During an interview with police, the boy said his first sexual encounter with the teacher took place at her home where he stayed for two weeks. Court documents cited by Fox59 state that in the course of their affair, which lasted until the summer of 2013, the married teacher\\'s aide bought the victim alcohol and two cars. As her first affair was winding down, Ladd allegedly began exchanging sexually explicit text messages with another 17-year-old boy nor long after he was released from a juvenile center, where he had been sent for committing a burglary. The teen told sheriff’s deputies he and Ladd consummated their relationship for the first time in April 2013, and the pair continued seeing each other romantically until November 2014, reported Kokomo Tribune. According to investigators, Ladd again was showering her teenage lover with presents, which included handguns, despite his criminal history. Preying on the weak: Ladd is an instructional assistant with the Maconaquah School Corporation\\'s alternative program, working with middle and high school students struggling with homework or social skills. When questioned by police last month, Ladd allegedly admitted to both trysts. Maconaquah School Corporation Superintendent Dr. Doug Arnold said news of Ladd\\'s arrest came as a shock to him because the educator has been effective in the classroom, working with middle and high school students struggling with homework or social skills. Mrs Ladd has been released on $56,000 bond. She is due back in court February 19.\\n\\nWhat are highlight points?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

In April and May, 54,000 fewer jobs were created than originally estimated, and the 215,000 jobs added in July didn’t change the picture of a faltering employment market. Wages have been rising at the slowest pace since the 1980s. Current numbers, according to the Financial Times, show a mere 0.2% rise in employment costs, or wages, against the 0.6% that the financial world expected.\\n\\nIt is the nature of recessions that the...\\n\\nA: In The Wall Street Journal, Mortimer Zuckerman asks who will get the dreary economy going—the worst U.S. recovery since World War II drags on, with insufficient notice from the White House or candidates aspiring to the Oval Office.\\n\\n\\nIN: Cyberbullying and a Student's Suicide\\nLast week, Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, jumped off the George Washington Bridge after a video showing him in an intimate encounter was surreptitiously posted on the Internet. His roommate and another student have been charged with invasion of privacy. Last spring, six high school students in Massachusetts were charged with bullying-related crimes, including violation of civil rights, after the target of the taunting, a 15-year-old classmate, killed herself.\\n\\nShould more laws be written to deal specifically with cyberbullying? If a victim commits suicide, should that factor into a decision to prosecute the accused bullies?\\nWhat is a short summary of the above article?\\n\\nOUT: Does the death of Tyler Clementi, a Rutgers student, argue for tougher laws against malicious acts online?\\n\\n\\nQ:\\nBig Music vs. Fans and Artists\\n“Fewer and fewer gatekeepers mean fewer choices and higher prices for fans,” he wrote. “One huge monolith means no choice at all. Fans and artists must develop some organized counterweight quickly or resign themselves to their fate.”\\n\\nA pretty grim forecast. Then on Thursday, a new CD by Jill Sobule arrived in the mail. “The California Years, Vol. 1” is a wonderful record, but the back story is just as good and a reminder that in among the giants, new models are emerging.\\n\\nMs. Sobule is a Denver native, a singer-songwriter who has been in the business for more than two decades and is probably best known for her 1995 song, “I Kissed a Girl.” In that time, she has been signed and dropped by two major labels and had two independent labels sign her, then go belly up.\\n\\nReluctant to go the label route again, she posted a question in a blog on allthingsd.com, the digital technology site owned by Dow Jones:\\n\\n“How do I pay the rent?”\\n\\nAfter listening to her fans, she came up with an updated version of the Medici model. To raise the $75,000 she needed for an album, she set up a Web site — jillsnextrecord.com — in which her fans would serve as patrons for her next record in return for various rewards.\\n\\nTen bucks earned them a digital download of the record, $50 an advance copy and a thank you in the liner notes, while $1,000 got them a personalized theme song written by the artist. Three people who paid $5,000 had Ms. Sobule play at their house. The person who gave $10,000 sang on the record.\\n\\nIf it sounds cheesy, like a virtual Tupperware party, consider that the record was produced by Don Was, who has produced Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones. The sessions, recorded in Hollywood at Henson Recording Studios, were available for streaming and comment on Ms. Sobule’s Web site before she chose the final songs. (One listener’s verdict? More cowbell, please.)\\n\\nReached at the TED conference (Technology, Entertainment, Design) in Palm Springs — Ms. Sobule is that rare plugged-in folkie — she said her version of digital busking had real benefits.\\n\\n“I have never received a single cent on a record that I have ever made,” she said, because sales never seemed to pay back the money she owed for an advance. “With all of this talk of new models and all of these big companies like Clear Channel and Live Nation trying to figure out a way to make a buck, this is one thing that makes sense for an artist like me. I have a small group of fans, but they are mighty.”\\n\\nMs. Sobule said that while the top of the business is busy finding ways to own more and more of what seems to be a shrinking pie, artists like her were tunneling their way to a direct route with their public. In a sense, the diminution in value of the CD has allowed musicians to re-examine what a contract with a label or a promoter really means.\\n\\nA year ago, Ms. Sobule sold thumb drives to people at her shows and gave them a password so that within a week, they could download a version of the live show. “The people who come to your shows are going to want to share an experience, to have something to remember, and it just makes sense that you give them that kind of opportunity.”\\n\\nMs. Sobule is less the tech evangelist than a working musician who likes what she does. Jillsnextrecord.com is not always as earnest as it sounds: It offered a $500 “Gold” level of donation in which your name was to be sung at the end of the record, but also a cheeky “Gold Doubloons Level”: “Exactly like the gold level, but you give me more money.”\\n\\n“I am never going to be a top 10, MTV person at this stage of my career, but this approach allowed me to make a record that I am proud of and I don’t owe anybody,” she said, and then corrected herself. “I still owe about 10 people theme songs.”\\n\\nAn earlier version of this column misstated the full name of TED.\\nWhat was this article about?\\nA:\\n\"},\n",

One of the country's most popular Christmas toys is selling online for more than twice its original price as parents scramble to get their hands on the must-have present. The LeapFrog LeapPad, a child's 'educational computer' which normally costs £79.99, is being sold on eBay and Amazon for over £170 as stocks run low nationwide. Numbers of the toy are running low after a sudden rush of sales saw it become September's best-selling toy in terms of value. In demand: The LeapFrog LeapPad toy is set to be one of the biggest sellers this year and has doubled in price online. Its rival - the VTech InnoTab - is also seeing soaring sales. Adam Christopher, from toy price comparison website kidstoptoys.co.uk, said: 'Most retailers have been sticking to the recommended retail price for the LeapPad and InnoTab now, with the exception of Amazon and Tesco. 'Tesco has been selling the InnoTab for £63.99, which has been one of the cheapest prices. 'It's on sites like eBay, the Amazon sellers market and the Play.com sellers market where we have seen prices topping £150. I guess it happens every year with certain toys.' The LeapPad, a learning tablet for kids, features a built-in camera, video recorder, reading apps and hundreds of games, is flying off the shelves in toy shops. It is selling on eBay's highest 'Buy It Now' offer for £175 while on Amazon the toy is available for a minimum of £127.99 and a maximum of £169.99. Some traders are even buying Argos reservation numbers to sell on eBay. Asking price: This advert on eBay advertised the LeapPad Explorer with a Toy Story game and carry case for a whopping £199.99. The LeapPad's rival, the VTech InnoTab - is also seeing soaring sales but costs upwards of its normal £63 asking price. The popularity of the LeapPad has increased since it was named in the Toy Retailers Association's 'Dream Dozen' gadgets for Christmas. It has been a sell-out success and has usurped Lego's Minifigures to become September's most valuable toy. Retailers have been altering prices of the LeapPad, as well as the InnoTab, to take advantage of the short supply. Others have been limiting customers to one purchase to combat the listings on eBay and Amazon. Robert. Dekker, senior marketing director at LeapFrog, said the company would. be replenishing supplies at various points to be divided equally between. retailers. He said: 'Ultimately, everybody should be able to get hold of a LeapPad, perhaps just not in time for Christmas. 'We. administer the recommended retail price to all retailers, however, the. prices chosen by individual stockists are beyond our control.'\\nout: eBay and Amazon sell £80 LeapPad for £170.\\nQuestion: Tariq Ahmad, 35, who worked at Nur-Ul-Islam Academy, Florida, has been accused\\xa0of the sexual abuse and rape of two middle school female pupils. Police are hunting the former head teacher of  a private Islamic school accused of the sexual abuse and rape of two middle school female students. Tariq Ahmad, 35, who worked at Nur-Ul-Islam Academy, Florida, has been charged with five first degree counts after the alleged abuse which left one student needing 'substantial surgical repair'. The girls were  aged 14 and 15 when Ahmad allegedly forced them into sexual relationships, according to a lawsuit. Their attorneys said Ahmed would use text messages, social media and even code on the chalk boards in the classroom to set up meetings with the girls. They also claim the Academy officials knew of Ahmed's illegal conduct for years and did nothing until now. Pembroke Pines police said the alleged incidents occurred between 2006 and 2008, but the pupils only came forward after years of therapy. In a statement, the school said: 'Recently, we have become aware of disturbing allegations regarding a former teacher of Nur-ul-Islam Academy. 'These allegations relate to alleged acts of the teacher six to eight years ago, which did not occur on the school's premise, concerning at least one former student of the Academy. 'Upon learning of these allegations, the Academy immediately suspended the teacher's employment, barred him from any further contact with Academy students and has since terminated his employment with the Academy. 'Although none of the acts are alleged to have occurred on the Academy's campus, such acts, if true, clearly violate the conduct policy of the Academy, along with being a gross dereliction of the high level of moral character the Academy expects from its faculty. 'The Academy's primary concern is to foster a safe and caring environment for all of its students, in which they can flourish personally and academically. A LinkedIn profile in Ahmad's name said he most recently served as the 'head of high school' at the academy, where he started working in August 2006. 'The Academy, therefore, has undertaken a full review of its policies to determine what, if anything, needs to be done to further ensure the safety of our students. 'In the spirit of Islamic teachings, we offer prayers for the well-being of all our students, current and former.' Attorney Scott Mager said: 'There was significant sexual abuse, intercourse and other inappropriate behaviour such that one of the students had to have substantial surgical repair of that (private) area. It's horrific. 'He would use the chalk board to arraign for times and places to meet victims after school,' said attorney Michael Dolce. The attorneys claim Nur-Ul-Islam Academy officials knew of Ahmed's illegal conduct for years and did nothing until now. 'They knew in 2008. What do they do? Absolutely nothing, expect accuse the kid of doing it. What do they do, they blame, they cover up, they don't tell the parents,' said Mr Mager. Pembroke Pines Police are currently looking for Ahmad who allegedly fled the jurisdiction after he was made aware of his pending charges. Sergeant Carlos Corretjer said:\\xa0'There is an investigation, it's still an open case,' Corretjer said. 'We're still trying to locate him.' The attorneys for the two students are asking anyone who may have information as to where Ahmed might be to contact Pembroke Pines Police immediately. A LinkedIn profile in Ahmad's name said he most recently served as the 'head of high school' at the academy, where he started working in August 2006.

       "    'content': 'News: Justin Bieber has been sentenced to two years\\' probation and must pay a fine of $80,900 (£47,181) in damages, after pleading no contest on Wednesday to a misdemeanour vandalism charge for throwing eggs at a neighbour\\'s home.\\n\\nThe 20-year-old Grammy-nominated singer, who was not present for the arraignment in California, was also ordered to complete five days of community service and a 12-week anger management programme, and to stay away from the victim and his family for two years. Bieber\\'s lawyer, Shawn Holley, entered the plea on his behalf.\\n\\nDeputy district attorney Alan Yochelson called egg throwing an \"extremely immature and silly act\" and said that he was satisfied with the misdemeanour charge.\\n\\nFollowing the incident, which took place in January, prosecutors have spent months deciding whether to file charges, and considered felony charges because the cost of damages was said to be over the threshold for a felony ($400).\\n\\nOn 14 January, detectives searched Bieber\\'s home looking for surveillance footage that might serve as evidence, after the singer was said to be involved in an egg-tossing vandalism case causing several thousands of dollars in damage.\\n\\nDetectives later filed a search warrant to obtain images from Bieber\\'s Instagram account to match them to surveillance footage taken from his home. A detective wrote that a person matching Bieber\\'s description was seen high-fiving his friends after running towards a neighbour\\'s home, but footage of the egg attack was not captured.\\n\\nBieber was not arrested during the search of his home, but his friend and personal manager Xavier Domonique Smith was charged with felony drug possession. Smith, an aspiring rapper who goes by the name Lil Za, pleaded no contest to felony possession of ecstasy and was sentenced to probation and a drug treatment programme.\\n\\nBieber has since moved into a Beverly Hills condominium. A spokeswoman for the singer said he\\'s glad to have the matter resolved and behind him.\\n\\nAside from the egg throwing case, Bieber faces two other cases in Florida and Toronto: the singer turned himself into Toronto authorities on 29 January on a charge that he assaulted a limo driver in December 2013, while a Miami court has set a trial date this month for his driving under the influence case, which also includes charges that he resisted arrest without violence and was driving with an expired license.\\n\\nLast month, the singer faced further controversy when a media outlet obtained footage of the singer said to be using racist language. He apologised for the language used throughout both videos, explaining, \"I need to step up and own what I did. I am sorry for all those I have let down and offended.\"\\n\\nFirst rising to fame at age 15, Justin Bieber has since released four studio albums. He was nominated for two Grammy awards for his 2010 full-length album debut, My World 2.0.\\n\\nTitle: Justin Bieber given two years\\' probation for egging incident\\n\\n\\nNews: ARLINGTON, Tex., June 17 Washington Nationals Manager Frank Robinson and his counterpart with the Anaheim Angels, Mike Scioscia, were each suspended for one game and issued a fine Friday by Major League Baseball officials for \"aggressive and inappropriate actions\" in the Nationals\\' victory over the Angels on Tuesday night in Anaheim, Calif., that resulted in a benches-clearing altercation.\\n\\nRobinson, who said his fine was $1,000, vehemently disagreed with the decision. He was granted a hearing with John McHale, MLB\\'s executive vice president for administration, by teleconference at noon Monday, and will be allowed to manage in the weekend series against the Texas Rangers here. Should his appeal fail, he would serve the suspension Monday night at Pittsburgh, and bench coach Eddie Rodriguez would manage the club.\\n\\n\"John will make the ruling,\" said Bob Watson, baseball\\'s vice president for on-field operations, late Friday night. \"He\\'ll rule on his timetable. I would imagine it would be a day or two, but it might be right on the spot.\"\\n\\nScioscia served his suspension Friday night in the Angels\\' game against the Florida Marlins. Angels pitcher Brendan Donnelly -- whose use of pine tar on his glove precipitated the incident -- was suspended for 10 games, but is appealing the suspension and was available to pitch against Florida.\\n\\nRobinson, who has been very clear that he feels the incident was Scioscia\\'s fault, voiced his displeasure with the ruling before Friday\\'s game.\\n\\n\"Number one, I didn\\'t instigate the situation,\" Robinson said. \"I didn\\'t bring it up. I didn\\'t start it. All I was doing was replying to what he had said to me. And it was all words.\"\\n\\nWatson would not comment on Robinson\\'s argument, other than to say, \"Believe me, I\\'ve heard his side of it.\"\\n\\nThe confrontation occurred in the top of the seventh inning in a game the Angels led 3-1. Scioscia called Donnelly in to relieve, but before the right-hander could throw a pitch, Robinson asked the umpires to examine Donnelly\\'s glove. They discovered pine tar -- a sticky substance which can improve the grip on a ball and possibly alter its flight -- and Donnelly was immediately ejected.\\n\\nAfter Scioscia called for a new pitcher, he walked directly from the mound to Robinson, who was standing on the first base line, and said he would have every Nationals pitcher \"undressed\" by the umpires, in search of foreign substances. Robinson considered that \"a threat,\" and charged back at Scioscia, leading to players streaming from the dugouts and bullpens.\\n\\n\"I think this is too severe,\" Robinson said. \"The fine and a suspension is too severe. Nothing else happened even though the players came out onto the field. Nothing happened.\"\\n\\nDonnelly said he had \"no anger,\" but said he is appealing to get the penalty reduced.\\n\\n\"Similar circumstances with other players have resulted in lesser lengths in penalties,\" Donnelly told reporters in Anaheim. \"I\\'m not using it to cheat.\"\\n\\nTitle:'},\n",

The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable (iMac G3) to upscale (iMac G4) and subsequent releases are considered premium all-in-ones. By contrast the MSRP of the MacBook laptop lines have dropped through successive generations such that the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro constitute the lowest price of entry to a Mac, with the exception of the even more inexpensive Mac Mini (the only sub-$1000 offering from Apple, albeit without a monitor and keyboard), not surprisingly the MacBooks are the top-selling form factors of the Macintosh platform today. The use of Intel microprocessors has helped Macs more directly compete with their Windows counterparts on price and performance, and by the 2010s Apple was receiving Intel\\'s latest CPUs first before other PC manufacturers.\\nIn 2009, how many Macs sold were laptops?\\nA: seven out of ten\\n\\nContext and question: Red is the traditional color of warning and danger. In the Middle Ages, a red flag announced that the defenders of a town or castle would fight to defend it, and a red flag hoisted by a warship meant they would show no mercy to their enemy. In Britain, in the early days of motoring, motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse-drawn vehicles, before the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 abolished this law. In automobile races, the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers. In international football, a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red penalty card and ejected from the game.\\nUnder what circimstance is a red flag flown in auto racing?\\nAnswer: if there is danger to the drivers\\n\\nQuestion: The classical period of Greek civilization covers a time spanning from the early 5th century BC to the death of Alexander the Great, in 323 BC (some authors prefer to split this period into \\'Classical\\', from the end of the Persian wars to the end of the Peloponnesian War, and \\'Fourth Century\\', up to the death of Alexander). It is so named because it set the standards by which Greek civilization would be judged in later eras. The Classical period is also described as the \"Golden Age\" of Greek civilization, and its art, philosophy, architecture and literature would be instrumental in the formation and development of Western culture.\\nIs there an answer to this question:  What isn\\'t so well known about this period?\\n\\nAnswer: unanswerable\\n\\nQUES: Broadcasters were faced with having to adapt daily to the varied recording characteristics of many sources: various makers of \"home recordings\" readily available to the public, European recordings, lateral-cut transcriptions, and vertical-cut transcriptions. Efforts were started in 1942 to standardize within the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB), later known as the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters (NARTB). The NAB, among other items, issued recording standards in 1949 for laterally and vertically cut records, principally transcriptions. A number of 78 rpm record producers as well as early LP makers also cut their records to the NAB/NARTB lateral standard.\\n\\nWhat is the NAB?\\nWhat is the answer?\\nANS:'},\n",

McCain and the USS Lassen.\\n\\nThe whereabouts and plans of the George Washington have been a subject of intense speculation for weeks as tensions have risen between North and South Korea. In March, the Cheonan, a South Korean warship, sank in a mysterious torpedo attack, killing 46 sailors; a team of international investigators later blamed North Korea for the incident.\\n\\nU.S. and South Korean officials said in June that they would organize additional joint war-fighting exercises in the region as a show of force to deter North Korea from further attacks. At the time, press reports from Seoul and Washington indicated that the George Washington -- whose home port is Yokosuka, Japan -- and its strike group would join the exercises, though the Pentagon said publicly that no decision had been made.\\n\\nComplicating matters: vocal opposition from China, which has said the presence of the U.S. carrier in the neighborhood would be a \"provocation.\"\\n\\nPentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell told reporters traveling with Gates to Seoul that the George Washington would participate in joint exercises with South Korean forces as soon as it departs Busan on Sunday. But he didn\\'t say where, exactly, the ship would go or how long it would participate in the war games.\\n\\n\"It\\'s there as an additional manifestation of our steadfast commitment to the Republic of Korea,\" Morrell said, referring to the government in Seoul. Overall, he said, the U.S.-South Korean exercises would last for \"the next several months\" in both the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan.\\n\\nMore details will be released, he said, after Gates meets Tuesday with South Korean Defense Minister Kim Tae-Young.\\n\\nThe comments to this entry are closed.\\nPlease write a summary below.\\n'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: Eating and drinking too much sugar can be bad for your health, but sometimes it\\'s tricky to know exactly how much sugar is in the food we buy.\\nSo now an app supported by the government in England, has been launched to help you work out what\\'s in your food. You scan the item\\'s barcode and it should tell you the amount of sugar in it.\\nRicky went to meet some kids who have been keeping a close eye on what they eat.\\nWhat was that article about?\\n\\nA: An app supported by the government is designed to make it easier to stay healthy, by letting you know exactly what is in your food.\\n\\n\\n\"The nation\" is a flexible concept here, as this is a Scottish viewpoint, when everyone agrees that the energy market should remain British, if not expanding into a European single market, with the help of more sub-sea inter-connectors.\\nAppearing before the enterprise and energy committee are the big energy utilities, and their regulator.  Scottish Power and SSE (Scottish Hydro, to most of us) are among those under pressure over consumer bills.\\nThey had made it clear that prices were stuck while they waited to see if Ed Miliband and Labour would follow through on freezing prices. That interventionist policy also had the unintended consequence of raising investment risk.\\nWith Miliband defeated and a less interventionist government in power at Westminster, it follows that prices should now fall, and investment plans can be taken out the chiller.\\nHowever, SSE and Scottish Power have another major role to play in supplying energy. Along with National Grid, they have responsibility for keeping the energy distribution system functional. On that score, the pressure is being exerted in the other direction - telling politicians they need to get their acts together.\\nMSPs have been told there remains a significant risk that Scotland will be left without sufficient electric power, particularly if thermal plants, including Longannet, are closed down before there is sufficient capacity in place to import power from the south.\\nThat means that there will be several years when high demand for power will be met with low supply of renewable energy (a cold, windless period in winter, for instance) and there won\\'t be enough back-up in Scotland.\\nThe capacity to export renewable energy is being expanded, with new power lines, re-cabling and a sub-sea inter-connector from Ayrshire to Merseyside, at a cost of more than Â£1bn. The key elements should be operational by 2017. But it looks all the more important that this is available for importing power.\\nNational Grid calculates that only around half of Scotland\\'s peak demand (2.6GW, out of 5.4GW) can be met by inter-connectors with England until the west coast sub-sea connector is complete.\\nIf the north of Scotland lacks wind power, it can pull on 65% of what it needs at peak demand, at least until the new Beauly-Denny inter-connector is in place.\\nNational Grid has modelled around 1,000 scenarios for what could happen if the wind drops, without Longannet or the Cockenzie coal-burning power station and at least one other nuclear generator is out of action.  With the results in mind, they\\'re paying SSE to provide back-up capacity at its gas-burning plant in Peterhead.\\nScottish Power, which has responsibility for the grid in central and south Scotland, warns that the closure of Longannet power station, likely be March next year, will make resolution of an energy crisis in Scotland largely dependent on importing power from south of the border.\\nIt says current emergency plans depend on Longannet, so they need to be re-drawn ahead of its closure.  And medium-term, there needs to be new consideration of how to provide back-up capacity in Scotland.\\nOne option is to put gas-burning turbines into the former coal-burning plant at Cockenzie in East Lothian, but such an investment makes no financial sense at current profitability on gas-burning.\\nSSE, with responsibility for the grid in the north of Scotland, has other points to make to MSPs. In addition to payments made to generators to ensure spare capacity in case of shortfalls elsewhere, it wants to see more certainty and stability for pricing, lasting further into the future.\\nIt also returns to the question of the cost to generators of contributing to the National Grid from the North of Scotland.\\nThis involves a high charge per unit of electricity, while southern England gets a sizeable subsidy. It\\'s a pricing system intended to create incentives for generators to build close to population centres. And although the gap between northern cost and southern subsidy is being narrowed, it remains in place.\\nThis plays to that pervasive narrative of Scotland being disadvantaged by policy set in London. And SSE has a telling graphic illustration of how wide of the European norm this is:\\nThat shows Ireland is the only other part of Europe to have price incentives to help generators choose where they locate their power stations.  But Britain\\'s are far stronger price incentives, and far removed from the case for generating renewable power where it is most plentiful.\\nThey will be further complicated if the newly-elected Conservative government puts the brakes on onshore wind developments, responding to local community pressure.\\nOnce again, the industry sees this as short-term thinking, when it says it needs stability if it is to re-orient power supply around low-carbon technology.  SSE has a wonderfully diplomatic way of telling the government it\\'s wrong and should think again:\\nOne other argument being made by green groups as well as the power companies, is that back-up storage to keep the lights on when the wind drops could be much better supported.\\nPump storage is a specialised use of hydro power. It takes wind power when demand is low (at night) to pump water from a low to a high reservoir. That is then available for switching on at short notice, usually for short periods.\\nSSE has a plan on the drawing board for a big new project that has the potential to provide 600 megawatts (quarter of Longannet\\'s maximum output, or around 300 large wind turbines) for up to 50 hours. However, it sees \"no route to market\". In other words, the investment incentives are not there.\\nThe evidence reflects a lot of progress made on closing down the risk that the lights could go out, with next winter being the riskiest of all, and the problem of tight capacity margins persisting at least until 2018.\\nBut the evidence also requires a reality check for those saying Scotland can be self-sufficient in renewable energy and an exporter, and that it doesn\\'t need nuclear power.\\nIt can be a net exporter, but that brings with it more dependence on imports when renewable energy doesn\\'t deliver. And those imports are bound to include nuclear power - if not from England, then from further afield. Britain\\'s capacity for transferring power to and from the continent is being increased from 4GW to nearly 11.\\nThat\\'s the build-up of the Europe-wide electricity market, in which Scotland\\'s grid access charges become harder to explain, and in which solar power from the south will compete directly with wind and marine power from the north-west.\\n\\nSum: The challenge of keeping the lights on has returned to Holyrood, with MSPs looking into the security of the nation\\'s energy supply.\\n\\n\\nText: IPC Media said it would also consider closing its website, Nuts.co.uk.\\nNuts\\' readership, along with other \"lads mags\" like Zoo and Front, has dropped by more than 70% on average in the last eight years.\\nManaging Director at IPC Paul Williams said the publisher would give Nuts\\' staff all the help they needed.\\nHe added: \"After 10 years at the top of its market, we have taken the difficult decision to propose the closure of Nuts and exit the young men\\'s lifestyle sector.\"\\nDoug McCabe, media analyst at Enders Analysis, said Nuts\\' closure had been \"on the cards for some time\".\\nHe said: \"Men\\'s magazines have been falling for some time. One reason is the migration of the readership online.\\n\"Also, to put it in macro terms, magazines are much more a female consumption format.\"\\nMr McCabe said male readers were veering away from the \"cheeky, slightly smutty\" magazines like Nuts, but still opting for men\\'s magazines like GQ or Esquire, which provided more quality writing.\\n\"In the end, people buy Nuts for the pictures and the comedy, but a lot of that they can find online now,\" Mr McCabe added.\\nsummary:'},\n",

       "    'content': \"The kingdom of Assam was the last conquest of Bodawpaya. In December 1816, he sent a 16,000-strong force to Assam to install his nominee, Chandra Kanta Singh, to the Assamese throne. From their northernmost forts in Hukawng Valley in present-day northern Kachin State, the Burmese army crossed the 9,000-foot high Himalayan Patkai range, and finally entered Assam in early 1817. The army decisively defeated the Assamese army at the battle of Kathalguri, near the Assamese capital Jorhat. A pro-Burmese minister Badan Chandra was installed, with Singh as the nominal king. The army left in April 1817 but instabilities resumed soon after, and Singh had to flee Jorhat. The army had to return in February 1819, and reinstated Singh. A large portion of the army remained in Assam to hunt down the rebels in Upper Assam. The authority rested with the Burmese commanders, not the nominal king. Unhappy with the arrangement, Singh switched his allegiance to the British in April 1821, and tried to drive out the Burmese. His first attack on the Burmese garrison at Gauhati in September 1821 failed. But reinforced by British arms and personnel, Singh took Gauhati in January 1822, and marched to Jorhat. But the capital had been reinforced by a 20,000-strong army led by Bandula, who had just arrived. Bandula defeated Singh on 17 April 1822 at Mahgarh near Jorhat. Singh fell back to Gauhati but was defeated by Gen. Maha Thilawa on 3 June 1822. The fallen king fled to the British territory, and continued to make raids in the years leading to the First Anglo-Burmese War.\\n\\nHow many years spanned these events?\\nA: 5\\n\\nTrying to snap a six-game losing skid, the Raiders flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 12 AFC West rematch with the Kansas City Chiefs.

In the second quarter, the Raiders drew closer as Janikowski kicked a 54-yard field goal. However, Kansas City managed to get one last strike prior to halftime as kicker Dave Rayner nailed a 30-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Oakland regained the lead with RB LaMont Jordan getting a 5-yard TD run.  However, the Chiefs retook the lead with Smith getting a 5-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Raiders once again jumped into the lead as RB Justin Fargas got a 14-yard TD run.  This time, the defense managed to hold on for the win. With the win, not only did the Raiders improve to 3-8, but they managed to do four things with their one win. First, they snapped their six-game losing skid. Second, they snapped a nine-game losing skid to the Chiefs. Third, they snapped a 17-game losing streak against divisional opponents with their first divisional win since 2004.

In the second quarter, Buffalo took the lead as kicker Rian Lindell made a 21-yard field goal.  Kansas City answered with Thigpen completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez.  Buffalo regained the lead as Lindell got a 39-yard field goal, while rookie CB Leodis McKelvin returned an interception 64 yards for a touchdown.  The Chiefs struck back with kicker Connor Barth getting a 45-yard field goal, yet the Bills continued their offensive explosion as Lindell got a 34-yard field goal, along with QB Trent Edwards getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Buffalo continued its poundings with Edwards getting a 5-yard TD run, while Lindell got himself a 38-yard field goal.  Kansas City tried to rally as Thigpen completed a 45-yard TD pass to WR Mark Bradley, yet the Bills replied with Edwards completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Josh Reed.  In the fourth quarter, Buffalo pulled away as Edwards completed a 17-yard TD pass to TE Derek Schouman.  The Chiefs tried to come back as QB Quinn Gray completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Dwayne Bowe, yet the Bills' lead was too much for Kansas City to overcome.

       "    'content': 'Question:\\nA Bond girl is a character (or the actress portraying a character) who is an attractive love interest and/or female sidekick of James Bond in a novel, film, or video game. Bond girls occasionally have names that are double entendres or puns, such as Pussy Galore, Plenty O\\'Toole, Xenia Onatopp, or Holly Goodhead, and are considered \"ubiquitous symbol[s] of glamour and sophistication.\" There is no set rule on what kind of person a Bond girl will be or what role she will play. She may be an ally or an enemy of Bond, pivotal to the mission or simply eye candy.\\nThe role of a Bond girl, as it has evolved in the films, is typically a high-profile part that can sometimes give a major boost to the career of unestablished actresses, although a number of Bond girls were well-established beforehand. For instance, Diana Rigg and Honor Blackman were both cast as Bond girls after they had already become stars in the United Kingdom for their roles in the television series, The Avengers. In addition, Halle Berry won an Academy Award in 2002--the award was presented to her while she was filming Die Another Day. Teri Hatcher was already known for her role as Lois Lane in the television series Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman before she was cast in Tomorrow Never Dies. A few years after playing a Bond girl, she became one of the most highly paid actresses on television, starring in Desperate Housewives. Jane Seymour was an unknown when she was cast in Live and Let Die (the opening credits read \"Introducing Jane Seymour\"), later won an Emmy Award for playing Maria Callas in a TV movie and then became a household name playing the title role in her TV series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. Kim Basinger had perhaps the most successful post-Bond career. After her break-out role in Never Say Never Again, Basinger went on to win an Academy Award for her performance in L.A. Confidential and to star in a number of blockbuster films, including Batman and 8 Mile, over the next two decades.  Broccoli\\'s original choice for the role of Domino Derval was Julie Christie following her performance in Billy Liar in 1963. Upon meeting her personally, however, he was disappointed that she did not have the full figure he was looking for and turned his attentions towards Raquel Welch after seeing her on the cover of the October 1964 issue of Life magazine. Welch, however, was hired by Richard Zanuck of 20th Century Fox to appear in the film Fantastic Voyage the same year instead. French actress Claudine Auger was ultimately cast in the role. Thunderball launched Auger into a successful European film career but did little for her in the United States.  At one time it was said that appearing as a Bond girl would damage an actress\\'s career. Lois Chiles is often cited as a case in point, even though her career did not suffer because of her portrayal of Holly Goodhead, but rather because, after she lost her younger brother to non-Hodgkin lymphoma, she decided to take a three-year break from acting, from which her career never recovered. Casting for the female lead in Casino Royale (2006) was hindered by potential actresses\\' concerns about the effect that playing the role might have on their careers. At that point, some thought that the Bond series had become stale and would therefore be a less desirable vehicle for young actresses. Nevertheless, the up-and-coming actress Eva Green agreed to play the role of Vesper Lynd, and showed those fears to be unfounded when she won BAFTA\\'s Rising Star Award for her performance. Rosamund Pike, who made her feature film debut as Miranda Frost in Die Another Day (2002), went on to earn an Academy Award Nomination for Gone Girl.\\nAnswer this question using a quote from the text above:\\n\\nWere there other things that had an effect?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nAt one time it was said that appearing as a Bond girl would damage an actress\\'s career.\\nAnswer the question at the end by quoting:\\n\\nLeonard Peltier (born September 12, 1944) is a Native American activist, a citizen of the Anishinabe & Dakota/Lakota Nations, and member of the American Indian Movement (AIM). In 1977, he was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for first-degree murder in the shooting of two Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents during a 1975 conflict on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Peltier\\'s indictment and conviction have been the subject of much controversy; Amnesty International placed his case under the \"Unfair Trials\" category of its Annual Report: USA 2010. Peltier is incarcerated at the United States Penitentiary, Coleman in Florida.\\nPeltier has made a number of appeals against his murder convictions.  In 1986, Federal Appeals Judge Gerald W. Heaney, concluded, \"When all is said and done ... a few simple but very important facts remain. The casing introduced into evidence had in fact been extracted from the Wichita AR-15.\" In his 1999 memoir, Peltier admitted that he fired at the agents, but denies that he fired the fatal shots that killed them.  A cartridge case from the Wichita AR-15 was found in the trunk of Agent Coler\\'s car, and admitted as evidence at Peltier\\'s trial in Fargo, North Dakota. Also admitted as evidence was the fact that no person involved in shooting at the agents, other than Peltier, possessed an AR-15 rifle.  The journalist Scott Anderson said that in a 1995 interview with Peltier, he sought answers to the contradictions he had found in Peltier\\'s accounts of the incident on June 26, 1975. When asked about the guns he carried that day, Peltier listed a .30-30, a .303, a .306, a .250 and a .22, but he did not remember the AR-15.  The former United States Attorney General Ramsey Clark has served pro bono as one of Peltier\\'s lawyers and has aided in filing a series of appeals on Peltier\\'s behalf. In all appeals, the conviction and sentence have been affirmed by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. The last two appeals were Peltier v. Henman, 997 F. 2d 461 in July 1993 and United States v. Peltier, 446 F.3d 911 (8th Cir. 2006) (Peltier IV) in 2006.\\n\\nWhat were those facts?\\n\\n'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Background: Stefanie Graf was born on 14 June 1969, in Mannheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, West Germany, to Heidi Schalk and Peter Graf (18 June 1938 - 30 November 2013), a car and insurance salesman. When she was nine years old her family moved to the neighbouring town of Bruhl. She has a younger brother Michael. Graf was introduced to tennis by her father, an aspiring tennis coach, who taught his three-year-old daughter how to swing a wooden racket in the family\\'s living room.\\nContext: In late 1999 and early 2000, as part of her Farewell Tour, Graf played a series of exhibition matches against former rivals in New Zealand, Japan, Spain, Germany and South Africa. She played Jelena Dokic in Christchurch, New Zealand, Amanda Coetzer in Durban, South Africa, and her former rival Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Zaragoza, Spain. It was Graf and Sanchez Vicario\\'s first head-to-head meeting since 1996. In February 2000, Graf played against Kimiko Date at Nagoya Rainbow Hall in Tokyo, winning in three sets. In September 2004, Graf dispatched her former doubles partner Gabriela Sabatini in straight sets, in an exhibition match played in Berlin, Germany. She was also in Berlin to host a charity gala, as well as inaugurating a tennis stadium renamed the \"Steffi Graf Stadion\". Proceeds from her match against Sabatini went to Graf\\'s foundation, \"Children for Tomorrow\".  In July 2005, Graf competed in one tie of World Team Tennis (WTT) on the Houston Wranglers team. She was beaten in two out of three matches, with each match being one set. Graf lost her singles match to Elena Likhovtseva 5-4. She teamed with Ansley Cargill in women\\'s doubles against Anna Kournikova and Likhovtseva but lost 5-2. She was successful, however, in the mixed doubles match. Graf completely ruled out a return to professional tennis. In October, Graf defeated Sabatini in an exhibition match in Mannheim, Germany, winning both of their sets. Like the exhibition match the previous year against Sabatini, proceeds went to \"Children for Tomorrow\".  In 2008 Graf lost an exhibition match against Kimiko Date at Ariake Colosseum in Tokyo. As part of the event, billed as \"Dream Match 2008\", she defeated Martina Navratilova in a one-set affair 8-7, with Graf winning a tiebreaker 10-5. It was the first time in 14 years Graf had played Navratilova. Graf played a singles exhibition match against Kim Clijsters and a mixed doubles exhibition alongside husband Andre Agassi against Tim Henman and Clijsters as part of a test event and celebration for the newly installed roof over Wimbledon\\'s Centre Court in 2009. She lost a lengthy one-set singles match to Clijsters and also the mixed doubles.  In 2010, Graf participated in the WTT Smash Hits exhibition in Washington, D.C. to support the Elton John AIDS Foundation. She and Agassi, her husband, were on Team Elton John, which competed against Team Billie Jean King. Graf played in the celebrity doubles, women\\'s doubles, and mixed doubles before straining her left calf muscle and being replaced by Anna Kournikova.\\nQuestion: What other interesting information did you find out?\\nAnswer: Graf defeated Sabatini in an exhibition match in Mannheim, Germany,\\n\\nBackground: Tara Ann VanDerveer (born June 26, 1953) is an American basketball coach who has been the head women\\'s basketball coach at Stanford University since 1985. Designated the Setsuko Ishiyama Director of Women\\'s Basketball, VanDerveer led the Stanford Cardinal to two NCAA Women\\'s Division I Basketball Championships: in 1990 and 1992. She stepped away from the Stanford program for a year to serve as the U.S. national team head coach at the 1996 Olympic Games. VanDerveer is the 1990 Naismith National Coach of the Year and a ten-time Pac-12 Coach of the Year.\\nContext: VanDerveer was born on June 26, 1953, to Dunbar and Rita VanDerveer, who named their first child \"Tara\" after the plantation in Gone with the Wind. She was born in Melrose, Massachusetts, a part of Greater Boston, but grew up in a small town in West Hill, near Schenectady, New York. Her parents were interested in a well-rounded education. Her father was studying for a doctorate at the school now known as the University at Albany. He took the family to Chautauqua in the summer, where she immersed in arts as well as sports. At the age of ten, her parents bought her a flute, and arranged for lessons. Two years later, one of the premier flutists in the world was staying in Chautauqua, and her father arranged for lessons with this distinguished teacher. Although she learned to play, she did not enjoy the experience, and gave up the flute in ninth grade. The love of music stayed with her though, and in later years she would take up the piano.  There were no sports teams for girls when she was in high school, but she played a number of sports including basketball, in rec leagues and pickup. When she was younger, she played with both boys and girls. As she entered her high school years, the girls dropped out for other interests, so she was more apt to play with boys. To help make sure she would be chosen, she bought the best basketball she could afford, so if the boys wanted to play with her basketball, they would have to pick her.  Her father wasn\\'t completely supportive of her basketball interest, calling her in from the neighbor\\'s basketball hoop, telling her, \"Basketball won\\'t take you anywhere. Come in and do your algebra.\" Tara was equally certain that algebra wasn\\'t going to take her anywhere. Her family moved to Niagara Falls in her sophomore year in high school. The house in West Hill had a gravel driveway, making a basketball hoop impractical, but when her parents got her a hoop for Christmas when they were in Niagara Falls. By then, she thought she was too old for basketball, although she would take it up again after she transferred to Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls college preparatory school, in her junior year. She ended up earning a place in the Buffalo Seminary\\'s Athletic Hall of Fame.\\nQuestion: What did she do with the piano?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

Dick Powell and Lucille Ball did good jobs with their roles; however, the writers gave them boring dialog. The love-interest between the two of them was not given any real growth; just suddenly it was there. I did not think much of the music; the best number was the snippet we heard of Spike Jones with \"Der Fuhrer\\'s Face.\" The one complete number that Spike Jones did had little of his great musical comedy; pretty tame stuff,even with the monkey. Bert Lahr\\'s comedy skits were interminable.\\n\\nThere were parts to enjoy: Lucille Ball was quite a looker, and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen.\\n\\n\\nProblem: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive negative\\n=++++=\\nAnswer: Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandler\\'s film career but was digitized after a short time.\\n\\nGoing Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone\\'s favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard ain\\'t Dooley squat! End of file.\\n\\n\\nAn example of a movie review. positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\n\\nA: Paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music, and to fall madly in love - as is the case in this film. Boy meets girl, they fall in love, but something stands in their way of eternal happiness, the classic story.\\n\\nThe wonderful music of George Gerschwin complements the great dancing by Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron. \"An American in Paris\" is a humorous, light-hearted, loving film well worth watching.\\n\\n8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQ: What\\'s an example of a movie review?\\nAn example of a movie review is here: Gere and Danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders. Gere, who plays Babbage, refers to them as his flock. Gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out. He is training, new comer Allison, to take over his job. Gere sees his flock as very sick, disturbed puppies. He asks them questions that are not on the list, and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. He keeps getting warned for this behavior, hence the reason he is being replaced. During his final few days on the job, a young girl goes missing, and Babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray. Him and Allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone AWOL. So, he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police. That part is a little far fetched.\\n\\nThere is some sick, twisted stuff shown in this film. Like when Babbage and Allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other. Also, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. At the end of the film, we see what sick freaks they are. However, I wouldn\\'t call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: If you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers, then you will like this.\\n\\n\\nProblem: Write a positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) movie review.\\n\\nAnswer: I watched the presentation of this on PBS in the U.S. when it originally aired in 1988 (?).

Today I found this web site. I will give up the search.\\n\\nI too would like to buy this complete - 26 episodes - miniseries. After buying the DVDs I would read each book, then watch the episodes for that book.

My girlfriend likes -- for whatever strange, twisted reason (tradition, to torture me?) -- to come to this cesspool. Alright. I purchased some car windshield wipers at another, dirtier WalMart (I'll review that gem another day) and I misplaced the receipt. I always figured that WalMart prided itself on two things: lowest prices on its subpar product lines (which is not even true, RE: lowest prices) and taking anything back for exchange (they give you a gift card).  Someone forgot to tell the CS 'ASSOCIATE'/wench that treated me like a convicted rapist/thief while she performed the exchange for me.   I gave my girlfriend the gift card and said lets go. Something was wrong with their pharmacy (really typical, not atypical) so we could actually really go.

It's not fusion as in the dishes themselves are mixed, but more that the menu is. They have sushi, Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese dishes all in the same restaurant. Could be great for groups with difference tastes. You could also go family style and get a blend of different flavors to satisfy all your cravings at once.  The food itself is extremely good. I wasn't dissapointed in any of the dishes they brought us. We tried a Thai dish, the house rolls for an appetizer and a Chinese shrimp dish. All of it was fantastic and we left stuffed for sure.  The service was equally great. And the atmosphere is picture perfect. Definitely recommended!\\n\\n\\nProblem: What would be an example of an positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) review?\\n\\nAnswer: It was New Year's Day about 5 pm. I was worry about 4-6 hour wait but lucky me it turn out to only be an 48 min wait from start until I sat down at my table. I was very happy about that. This place has food selections for days. Not only there's a large food selection, everything I tried was so flavorful. The presation of the food was Beauiful.. For $50 a person. I think it's worth it. I will return. I hope they will add it back onto the buffet pass for the additional $15..  The only down part to this restaurant was the servers.

Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection.   I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .    My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.    Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.    Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.

The lenders held secret talks with the City watchdog this week to try to thrash out a deal. Those also involved in the negotiations are understood to include HSBC, US banks Citigroup and JPMorgan and Swiss lender UBS. Regulators in the U.S., Asia and Europe suspect traders conspired to fix the £3trillion-a-day ‘FX’ market by rigging rates used when buying and selling currencies. The\\xa0Financial Conduct Authority (above) is investigating. The fines are expected to be confirmed simultaneously, with the total bill set to be as high as £2billion and one bank facing a fine of between £300million and £400m. Regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe suspect traders conspired to fix the £3trillion-a-day ‘FX’ market by rigging rates used when buying and selling currencies. Martin Wheatley, of the Financial Conduct Authority, has previously warned the foreign exchange allegations are ‘every bit as bad as they have been with Libor’. Banks including Barclays, RBS and Lloyds have already been fined for rigging the London Interbank Offered Rate – or Libor – a benchmark used to set trillions of pounds of financial contracts including the price of mortgages. Barclays has also been fined £26million for rigging gold prices and is fighting a £300million penalty in the US for manipulating energy markets. Foreign exchange is the biggest financial market in the world, with £3trillion changing hands each day. Barclays has also been fined £26million for rigging gold prices and is fighting a £300million penalty in the US. The probe began last year with whistleblowers likening the unregulated market to the ‘Wild West’. Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down. The probe centres on claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders.\\nHighlights:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: This notion of \"a life\" is subjective. You need to reflect on what is important to you. What do you want to achieve in life? What makes you happy? Only once you think about those kinds of things will you begin to realize how to attain a life. Don\\'t let others define a meaningful life for you. While it is true that many people will tend to see certain things as more indicative of \"a life\" than others based on human universal needs, such as having kids or family, having fun experiences, or having meaningful work, ultimately, what matters most is what you personally find to be important. Write about the things that are bothering you in your own life or that excite you. Keeping a journal has been found to increase well-being and can help you find patterns in your life both positive and negative. More specifically, writing in a journal can help you clarify your thoughts and feelings, allow you to get to know yourself better, reduce stress, or solve problems by looking at them in a new light.  Figure out whatever kind of journal works best for you. You could write with pen and paper or keep a digital journal on your laptop. What matters most is getting your thoughts on paper and reflecting on them. Sometimes, the act of expressing yourself to another can give you an in depth view into what you want and need. In addition, other people may have insight into your life that you may be blind to. Consider booking an appointment with a counselor, if you do not want to talk to family or friends. Talk therapy can be very effective both at treating underlying emotional issues but also at giving your thoughts life and helping you sort through them. List the main areas of your life, such as social, work, spiritual, family, leisure, health, community and charity. Once you have broken your life down into these domains, reflect on whether you are happy with these aspects of your life. Getting a life usually means creating a balance among the domains of life you find to be important. Take to heart the phrase \"everything in moderation.\" Reduce activities that are not done in moderation to achieve a more balanced life. Say, for example, that you identify that you are not doing enough for your community and for your health. Spend some time thinking of ways to create more time to improve your life in these specific domains.  For example, you could make a list of a few charities you would like to inquire about. Regarding your health, you could take some time adjusting your budget to see if you can afford a gym membership. You could spend some time researching local sports teams you could join. If you are particularly busy, you may also have to think about where to cut back on to gain the extra time or resources. The best places to start are domains you think you are spending too much time on (e.g., work). Review the state of your life (you can do this in part by reading your journal) and decide if your life is more fulfilling with the changes you have made. The best way to decide is if you personally feel happier about your life. Remember not to think too much about what others may think about your life. You are the one living it, after all.  Give yourself time to change your life, as it won\\'t be easy. Try to focus on making small changes over a year. After a year is over, you should have a better idea of what makes you happy.\\nSummary: Define what a life is to you. Write in a journal. Discuss your life with others. Break your life down into domains. Brainstorm ways to create more time for areas that are lacking. Reassess your life every few months.\\n\\nProblem: Article: The rocks you choose should be based on your personal preferences. The combination of one larger and one smaller rock works well, or consider using long, thin rocks placed in rows for another nice effect. Consider using rocks of the same color and variety rather than a mixture; this can look more natural and harmonious. All the rocks should be buried so that half of the rock is covered with soil. Doing this will keep the rocks in place. You may wish to plant towards a single raised point, such as a tall rock or piece of driftwood arranged semi-vertically. A slightly triangular effect also works well. Most rock garden plants (such as Alpines) favor sun. If you plan to place your trough in a shady site then you may need to choose shade-tolerant plants. Plants like alpines and sedums, or Aubretia, work well in sun; consider planting ferns, begonias and small hostas in shade. Some gardeners swear by the rule ‘a thriller, a filler and a spiller’ for container planting. One showy plant to catch the eye and thrill it, a plant to fill out space and provide an attractive backdrop, and a trailing plant to spill over the edge and create an interesting organic shape. Remember to plant trailing plants near the edge of your trough so they cascade over the side. Remember that if you choose only plants that disappear over the winter, your rock garden will look very sad for several months of the year. Consider planting some evergreens such as the sedum Stonecrop or the alpine groundcover Matted Globularia\\u2028(Globularia repens). Rock gardens aren’t usually covered in plants that are crowded together. Leave your plants some breathing room and allow the rocks to be visible. They will need room to expand over time, especially if they are ground cover plants or creeping varieties. Once you finish planting your trough, consider adding an attractive inorganic mulch using something like pea shingle or shale. This sort of mulch will hide any bare soil between the rocks and plants and it will also stop the plant foliage from coming into contact with wet earth, which can cause the leaves to rot. Some alpines are adapted to absorb heat from the rocks they grow on. Mulch also suppresses weeds; weeds can be a problem in a rock garden because of the gaps between plants. Rock gardens aren’t intended to be high maintenance. You may need to attend to weeding. It’s important that your plants don’t drown in their planter. If drainage is a problem in the trough, consider sheltering it during the wetter winter months.  Consider feeding the plants in the springtime. Many of the alpines and sedums used in rock displays are very drought tolerant. However, you should consider watering during dry spells, depending on which plants you chose. If you are planting in shade, consider protecting plants such as hostas from slug and snail attack.\\nSummary:'},\n",

During these three rituals, the candidate is progressively taught the meanings of the Lodge symbols, and entrusted with grips, signs and words to signify to other Masons that he has been so initiated. The initiations are part allegory and part lecture, and revolve around the construction of the Temple of Solomon, and the artistry and death of his chief architect, Hiram Abiff. The degrees are those of Entered apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason.

OPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer:\\nyes\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nThe Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.  After reading the above, is \"That this wasn\\'t an accident\" the correct answer to the question \"What did the Secret Service not realize when it first set up precautions around the White House complex?\"? OPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer:\\nno\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nNeighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities\\' cultural isolation and service providers\\' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under $1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\" Dudovitz said. \"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to $20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \"The job is more satisfying than the money,\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.  After reading the above, is \"Tamil\" the correct answer to the question \"What languages spoken by the different attorneys of Neighborhood Legal Services? Name three\"?

On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert\\'s dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown\\'s hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown\\'s mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday, 2 February, in St George\\'s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.

With direct metal mastering (DMM), the master disc is cut on a copper-coated disc, which can also have a minor \"orange peel\" effect on the disc itself.

Within a day, Howard Jr. emailed me back and helped set up an appointment promptly. I went to the shop (very clean and neat) to have them look at my tire issues and also change the oil. My low-profile tires needed to be ordered from another shop which I was told would take about an hour or so.

An hour later, the shop called with my new tires and the same gentleman came to pick me up again. So easy!

North Korea is expanding its already extensive network of prison camps, eating up entire villages as\\xa0 it struggles to house hundreds of thousands of political prisoners, latest satellite images have revealed. The secretive communist regime has built a huge \\'security perimeter\\' around an existing camp restricting movement in nearby villages as part of its \\'general repression\\' of its people, human rights watchdog Amnesty International said today. The reclusive country\\'s network of political prison camps is believed to hold at least 200,000 people and has been the scene of rapes, torture, executions and slave labour, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in January. Satellite images show how North Korea is expanding its already sizeable network of prison camps. Clampdown: North Korea has built a huge \\'security perimeter\\' around a camp for political prisoners, restricting movement in nearby villages. Analysis of new satellite images of the area near Camp No. 14 in Kaechon shows that the government is \\'blurring the lines\\' between its camps and surrounding civilians, Amnesty said. The images show that between 2006 and 2013, North Korea has constructed 20 km (12 miles) of posts around the Ch\\'oma-Bong valley located 70km north of Pyongyang. The new perimeter encloses civilian villages with a series of check points and guard towers, Amnesty said in a statement voicing fears about government intentions for the valley, 70 km north of the capital Pyongyang. \\'The security and control adjacent to Camp 14 shows the degree to which general repression and restrictions on the right to liberty of movement have become commonplace in North Korea,\\' said Rajiv Narayan, North Korea researcher for Amnesty. Expansion: Satellite images reveal an increase in housing between 2008 and 2011, in North Korea\\'s Ch\\'oma-Bong valley. The images show that between 2006 and 2013, North Korea has constructed 20 km (12 miles) of posts around the Ch\\'oma-Bong valley located 70km north of Pyongyang. A satellite image shows what Amnesty International believes is the construction of an entrance gate in North Korea\\'s Ch\\'oma-Bong valley. The London-based group called on the U.N. Human Rights Council, holding its main annual session in Geneva through March 22, to launch an international commission of inquiry into grave and systematic violations \\'including crimes against humanity\\'. North Korea denies the existence of a network of camps. A similar U.N. investigation similar to the one Amnesty is demanding, made up of independent experts, has said it is documenting war crimes committed by both sides in Syria\\'s conflict so as to build a case for future prosecution. Top U.N. rights official Pillay, who met two North Korean camp survivors in December, has called for an independent investigation into \\'one of the worst - but least understood and reported - human rights situations\\'. Concerns about abuses in the impoverished country have persisted for years, but have been largely overshadowed in international forums by fears over North Korea\\'s attempts to become a nuclear weapons power. Blind obedience: North Koreans attend a political rally earlier this week. Criticism of the ruling communist regime is strictly forbidden. The U.N. Security Council is expected. to vote later on Thursday on a draft resolution in response to North. Korea\\'s third underground nuclear test last month. Amnesty commissioned DigitalGlobe to take the images and help with their analysis following reports of the possible construction of a new political prison camp adjacent to Camp No. 14 in Kaechon, South Pyongyan province. \\'Dear leader\\': 29-year-old North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. \\'We expected to find a new or expanded prison camp. What we found is in some ways even more worrisome,\\' said Frank Jannuzi, deputy executive director of Amnesty International USA. The security perimeter beyond what appears to be the formal boundaries of Camp 14 blurs the line between people in the prison system known as Kwan-li-so and civilians, he said. New buildings that appear to house workers are probably linked to expanded mining activity in the region, Amnesty said. Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans, including children, are held in political prison camps and other detention facilities, often subjected to forced hard labour, denial of food rations, and torture, it said. Many detainees have not committed any crime, but are relatives of those deemed unfriendly to the regime and detained as a form of \\'collective punishment\\', it added. Japan and the United States called last week for the council to launch an inquiry into alleged violations including torture and execution of political prisoners in North Korea. The council already has an independent investigator on North Korea, Marzuki Darusman, who has said a wider inquiry should examine personal and institutional accountability for crimes. Activists hope the forum adopts a resolution on North Korea by consensus now that neither China nor Russia are members.\\nHighlights: Images show new security perimeter enclosing entire civilian villages. Amnesty International claims \\'general repression\\' is now commonplace. Human rights watchdog is urging U.N. forum to launch inquiry on abuses.\\nin: Actor Charlie Sheen was released from a Colorado jail Friday after he was arrested on domestic-violence-related charges, Aspen police said. Sheen, 44, was charged with second degree assault and menacing, both felonies, and criminal mischief, a misdemeanor, police said. Additionally, Colorado law mandates a protective order between someone arrested for domestic violence and the victim. Police said the alleged victim, whom they did not identify, did not require a trip to a hospital. Sheen was released from the Pitkin County Jail at 7 p.m. local time after posting $8,500 bond. He is scheduled to appear in court February 8. His spokesman, Stan Rosenfield, cautioned against jumping to conclusions. \"Do not be misled by appearance,\" Rosenfield said. \"Appearance and reality can be as different as night and day.\" Sheen has been married to sometime actress and real estate investor Brooke Mueller Sheen, his third wife, since May 2008. The couple has twin sons born in March. Sheen stars in the popular television comedy \"Two and a Half Men\" with Jon Cryer.

       "    'content': 'Q:\\nFormer Abercrombie Ranch Hits Auction Block at Steep Discount\\nLuxury residential real estate sales may be bouncing back, but sluggish sales at the ultra high-end are making for some potentially deep discounts.\\n\\nThe latest to join the parade: Teton Valley Ranch, a 151-acre ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Originally listed for $47.4 million in the summer of 2008, the property is now scheduled for a July auction with a reserve price, or low estimate, of $15 million.\\n\\nThe owner, a Houston investor, bought the property in 2004 intending to use it as a family retreat, says listing agent Richard Lewis of Sotheby’s International Realty, which is selling the property with Concierge Auctions.\\n\\nThe owner and his family are instead spending most of their time at a large horse ranch outside Washington, D.C. purchased several years ago. “It makes no sense for them to have such a huge asset and never be here,” Mr. Lewis says.\\n\\nThe ranch comes with quite a pedigree: It was owned in the early 1900s by the Abercrombie family now known for the upscale teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch, according to a spokeswoman for Concierge Auctions. A subsequent owner operated the ranch for decades as a summer camp for children, including scions of the Rockefeller, Kennedy and DuPont families, Concierge says; the camp continues to operate today from another location.\\n\\nThe property can be purchased in its entirety or as one of two lots, one with a reserve of $11 million and the other, with a reserve of $4 million. The more expensive parcel is about 52 acres and has a more than 10,000-square-foot stone residence the owner was building for his family. It is is 90% complete, Mr. Lewis says, allowing the buyer to choose some of the finishes. The two-story mansion has floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the Teton mountain range, several fireplaces and about a half-mile of frontage on Gros Ventre River, a tributary of the Snake River. Items including doors and stained glass windows were sourced from European castles and churches; a stone staircase was taken out of a castle’s turret. A three-acre lake with a 70-degree, year-round temperature is adjacent to the home and can be used for swimming. The parcel also has a recently renovated log-cabin guest house with two bedrooms, a fireplace and a kitchen.\\n\\nThe other lot has a quarter-mile of river frontage. There’s a 1,700-square-foot building currently used as the caretaker’s home and two log cabins that could be used for guests. There’s also a barn that Mr. Lewis said has appeared in Marlboro commercials.\\n\\nThe lots will first be auctioned off individually, then collectively, with the lots selling for the highest collective price over the reserve. The auction is open to registered bidders and their agents and is scheduled for July 16 at 11 a.m. on the Kelly, Wyo. property. Telephone bids also will be accepted.\\nWhat was this article about?\\nA:\\nFormerly owned by the Abercrombie family, Teton Valley Ranch, once listed at $45 million, is scheduled for auction with a $15 million reserve in July.\\nQ:\\nLondon burns again for 350th anniversary of Great Fire\\nThe City of London has commemorated the anniversary of the blaze which razed it to the ground 350 years ago by safely reliving the destruction on a much smaller scale.\\n\\nWhich isn\\'t to say the doomed reconstruction of the city in 1666, which was torched overnight, was anything to sniff at.\\n\\nThe 120m-long wooden model was designed by US \"burn artist\" David Best and was reduced to ashes on a barge moored on the Thames.\\n\\nBaked goods were blamed for starting the original blaze, which over the course of four days destroyed some 13,200 homes, 87 churches and a cathedral.\\n\\nAbout 80 per cent of the city was left in ruins and some 70,000 people left without homes.\\n\\nRemarkably only six deaths were recorded as a result of the fire, over which a French watchmaker was hanged after he falsely claimed responsibility.\\n\\n\"Three-hundred and fifty years ago, when embers from a baker\\'s oven sparked one of the most catastrophic events the capital has ever witnessed, London\\'s economic prowess almost came to a fiery end,\" the ABC quotes Nick Bodger, head of cultural and visitor development for the City of London, as saying ahead of the event.\\n\\n\"A renewed sense of purpose saw the great city we enjoy today rise from those ashes, develop and thrive.\"\\n\\nThousands turned out to watch the reconstruction, which wrapped up a commemorative festival that began late last week.\\n\\n© Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2016\\nWhat was this article about?\\nA:\\n'},\n",

To defend against air attack set designers from the Warner Brothers Studios prepared elaborate camouflage that disguised the factory and airfield. The RAND Corporation began as a project of the Douglas Company in 1945, and spun off into an independent think tank on May 14, 1948. RAND eventually acquired a 15-acre (61,000 m²) campus centrally located between the Civic Center and the pier entrance.\\nQuestion: In what year was the Douglas Company founded?\\n\\nOutput: unanswerable\\n\\nQUES: In December 2005, Imperial announced a science park programme at the Wye campus, with extensive housing; however, this was abandoned in September 2006 following complaints that the proposal infringed on Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and that the true scale of the scheme, which could have raised £110m for the College, was known to Kent and Ashford Councils and their consultants but concealed from the public. One commentator observed that Imperial\\'s scheme reflected \"the state of democracy in Kent, the transformation of a renowned scientific college into a grasping, highly aggressive, neo-corporate institution, and the defence of the status of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty – throughout England, not just Wye – against rampant greed backed by the connivance of two important local authorities. Wye College campus was finally closed in September 2009.\\n\\nWhere was Imperial\\'s science park programme located?\\nWhat is the answer?\\nANS: Wye campus\\n\\nQUES: Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as Ezra Pound, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot considered humanism to be sentimental \"slop\" (Hulme)[citation needed] or \"an old bitch gone in the teeth\" (Pound) and wanted to go back to a more manly, authoritarian society such as (they believed) existed in the Middle Ages. Postmodern critics who are self-described anti-humanists, such as Jean-François Lyotard and Michel Foucault, have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal human nature, which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. \"Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal\", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls \"a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)\". Nevertheless, philosopher Kate Soper notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently \"secretes a humanist rhetoric\".\\nWho had no interest in discussing Humanism?\\n\\nANS: unanswerable\\n\\nYazid died while the siege was still in progress, and the Umayyad army returned to Damascus, leaving Ibn al-Zubayr in control of Mecca. Yazid\\'s son Muawiya II (683–84) initially succeeded him but seems to have never been recognized as caliph outside of Syria. Two factions developed within Syria: the Confederation of Qays, who supported Ibn al-Zubayr, and the Quda\\'a, who supported Marwan, a descendant of Umayya via Wa\\'il ibn Umayyah. The partisans of Marwan triumphed at a battle at Marj Rahit, near Damascus, in 684, and Marwan became caliph shortly thereafter.\\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What year did the partisans of Marwan lose a battle?\\nAh, so.. unanswerable\\n\\nQuestion: In modular arithmetic, two integers are added and then the sum is divided by a positive integer called the modulus. The result of modular addition is the remainder of that division. For any modulus, n, the set of integers from 0 to n − 1 forms a group under modular addition: the inverse of any element a is n − a, and 0 is the identity element. This is familiar from the addition of hours on the face of a clock: if the hour hand is on 9 and is advanced 4 hours, it ends up on 1, as shown at the right. This is expressed by saying that 9 + 4 equals 1 \"modulo 12\" or, in symbols,\\nTry to answer this question if possible: If the hour hand is on 1 and is advanced by 4 hours, where does it end up?\\nAnswer: unanswerable\\n\\nInput: Read this: There are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language.

In the 1920s John Fothergill (1876–1957) was the innkeeper of the Spread Eagle in Thame, Berkshire, and published his autobiography: An Innkeeper\\'s Diary (London: Chatto & Windus, 1931). During his idiosyncratic occupancy many famous people came to stay, such as H. G. Wells. United States president George W. Bush fulfilled his lifetime ambition of visiting a \\'genuine British pub\\' during his November 2003 state visit to the UK when he had lunch and a pint of non-alcoholic lager (Bush being a teetotaler) with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the Dun Cow pub in Sedgefield, County Durham in Blair\\'s home constituency. There were approximately 53,500 public houses in 2009 in the United Kingdom. This number has been declining every year, so that nearly half of the smaller villages no longer have a local pub.\\nWhat publishing house published An Innkeeper\\'s Diary?\\nAnswer: Chatto & Windus\\nContext and question: The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (officially abbreviated the Super NES[b] or SNES[c], and commonly shortened to Super Nintendo[d]) is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo that was released in 1990 in Japan and South Korea, 1991 in North America, 1992 in Europe and Australasia (Oceania), and 1993 in South America. In Japan, the system is called the Super Famicom (Japanese: スーパーファミコン, Hepburn: Sūpā Famikon?, officially adopting the abbreviated name of its predecessor, the Family Computer), or SFC for short. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy (슈퍼 컴보이 Syupeo Keomboi) and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics.

In volume 5 of his Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, published in 1788, Edward Gibbon wrote: \"The Latin Church has not disdained to borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception of his virgin mother.\" That he was speaking of her immaculate conception by her mother, not of her own virginal conception of Jesus, is shown by his footnote: \"In the xiith century the immaculate conception was condemned by St. Bernard as a presumptuous novelty.\" In the aftermath of the definition of the dogma in 1854, this charge was repeated: \"Strange as it may appear, that the doctrine which the church of Rome has promulgated, with so much pomp and ceremony, \\'for the destruction of all heresies, and the confirmation of the faith of her adherents\\', should have its origin in the Mohametan Bible; yet the testimony of such authorities as Gibbon, and Sale, and Forster, and Gagnier, and Maracci, leave no doubt as to the marvellous fact.\"\\nWhat was the group of volumes titled ?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

Bribery: Iraq’s ambassador to the U.S. said reports on alleged bribery by Unaoil have […]\\nWhat are the most important parts of this text?\\n\\nA: Iran has to fix its own banking system to win post-sanctions overseas business, the IMF said.\\n\\n\\nIN: Despite Doubt, Karzai Brother Retains Power\\nAhmed Wali Karzai, center, the brother of President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, meeting with elders in Kandahar Province.\\n\\nKANDAHAR, Afghanistan — Ahmed Wali Karzai, the most powerful man in southern Afghanistan, may maintain links with drug dealers and insurgents, as some American officials and Afghans believe. And he might have played a central role in last summer’s fraudulent presidential election, as Western diplomats charged.\\n\\nBut Mr. Karzai is also the brother of the Afghan president, Hamid. And after debating Ahmed Wali’s future for months — and with a huge military operation in the area looming — Afghan and American officials have decided that the president’s brother will be allowed to stay in place.\\n\\nOver the last several months, President Karzai has turned down repeated requests by both the American ambassador and the top American commander to move Ahmed Wali Karzai out of Kandahar, American officials here said. Many Western and Afghan officials say he stands in the way of building a just and efficient Afghan government, which they see as essential to dislodging the Taliban and eventually allowing American troops to withdraw.\\n\\nSenior American officials spent months weighing the allegations against Ahmed Wali Karzai: that he pays off Taliban insurgents, that he launders money, that he seizes land, that he reaps enormous profits by facilitating the shipment of opium through the area. And the officials concluded that the evidence, some compelling, some circumstantial, was not clear enough to persuade the president to move his brother out of town, two NATO officials said.\\n\\n“My recommendation was, remove him,” a senior NATO officer said this week, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “But for President Karzai, he’s looking at his brother, an elected official, and nobody has come to him with pictures of his brother loading heroin into a truck.”\\n\\nInstead, American and Afghan officials say they intend to use him to help persuade Taliban fighters to give up. Mr. Karzai has sometimes helped the American government communicate with Taliban insurgents. Recently, he has told American officials that he can help peel Taliban fighters away from the insurgency.\\n\\n“I absolutely think he can help us with reintegration,” the NATO officer said, referring to the American-backed program to coax fighters away from the insurgency.\\n\\nThe tug of war over President Karzai’s brother offers a vivid example of President Obama’s constraints in prosecuting the war here: While he and other American officials publicly goad Mr. Karzai into cleaning up his government, widely regarded as one of the most corrupt in the world, they appear to have quite limited power in doing much about it.\\n\\nAny decision about Ahmed Wali Karzai is complicated by his relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency, which maintains a large presence in Kandahar. Current and former American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, say the agency has paid Ahmed Wali Karzai regularly for many years for performing a variety of services.\\n\\nIn previous interviews, Ahmed Wali Karzai acknowledged that he had helped the American government battle the insurgency. But he has denied ever taking money from the C.I.A. He declined to be interviewed for this article. In previous interviews, he has also steadfastly denied engaging in any illegal activity.\\n\\nSome have regarded the case as a test of American will to confront President Karzai. “Watch what the Americans do,” said a diplomat in Kabul. “If they let Ahmed Wali stay in power, it means they are not serious about governance.”\\n\\nThe decision to leave Mr. Karzai in place comes as American commanders are preparing a huge military operation in and around the city of Kandahar, the Taliban’s spiritual home. The operation is seen as the fulcrum of the entire Afghan campaign, whose aim is to break the Taliban’s hold across its heartland of Kandahar and Helmand Provinces.\\n\\nAt the heart of Kandahar sits Ahmed Wali Karzai, who has been a prominent public figure in southern Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001.\\n\\nThere is little doubt here that few important matters are settled without him. The question debated by some American officials is whether he can also be of use to them.\\n\\nAmerican officials say he has provided extensive help in battling the insurgency. He helps the C.I.A. operate a paramilitary group, the Kandahar Strike Force, which is used for raids against suspected insurgents.\\n\\nAhmed Wali Karzai is also paid for allowing the C.I.A. and American Special Operations troops to rent a large compound outside the city, several American officials said.\\n\\nHe is also one of the area’s biggest entrepreneurs, with business and real estate ventures across southern Afghanistan. “One thing, he is a successful businessman,” the senior NATO official said. “He can create jobs.”\\n\\nBut Western and Afghan officials say the president’s brother is engaged in many activities that buoy the insurgency and undermine the Afghan state. These military and political officials say the evidence, though largely circumstantial, strongly suggests that he enriches himself by helping the illegal trade in poppy and opium.\\n\\n“If you don’t cooperate, then you don’t do business,” said a Western official in Kabul who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\nWhat is a short summary of the above article?\\n\\nOUT:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Q: TEXT: Australian journalist Peter Greste has revealed it was traumatic leaving his colleagues behind in a Cairo prison and he didn\\'t truly believe he was being freed until he was seated on a plane bound for Cyprus. Greste has used his first interview since being deported from Egypt to call on the country to release other detained journalists including Al Jazeera colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed. \\'You spend 400 days in such close proximity with people and you really get to know them very, very well,\\' the 49-year-old told Al Jazeera in Cyprus on Monday. Scroll down for video. Australian journalist Peter Greste speaks during an interview a day after his release from prison in Egypt. Greste appears in a defendants\\' cage in a courthouse near Tora prison in Cairo, Egypt in May last year. \\'So it was a very difficult moment walking out of that prison, saying goodbye to those guys, not knowing how much longer they will have to put up with this.\\' Greste said even when driving to the airport on Sunday he wondered if his ordeal was really coming to end given there\\'d been other moments when freedom appeared imminent but was \\'snatched away\\'. \\'So I really didn\\'t want to let myself believe it really was happening until I got my backside on a seat on the plane with my brother Mike and we knew, then, that for me at least, this is over.\\' The Australian said the key to surviving jail had been to stay fit physically, mentally and spiritually. Greste exercised by running, kept mentally fit by studying and remained spiritually strong through meditation. Greste\\'s family (left to right): mother Lois, brother Andrew and father Juris,  in Brisbane following his release. Greste\\'s family gave a press conference after he was released following 400 days in an Egyptian prison. \\'It was a way of enforcing a kind of discipline on myself and dealing with each day as it came,\\' he said. \\'Hopefully ... I\\'ve come out of it not too damaged.\\' The award-winning correspondent described his release as a massive step forward. \\'I just hope that Egypt keeps going down this path with the others,\\' he said. \\'If it\\'s appropriate for me to be free it\\'s right for all of them to be freed.\\' Greste wasn\\'t expecting to be released ahead of a scheduled retrial. However while running on Sunday the prison warden called him over and told him to pack his things. \\'I said \"What do you mean?\" and he said \"You\\'re going\" and I said \"Where, to another prison?\" and he said \\'No the (Australian) embassy is coming they\\'ll be here in an hour\\'.\\' Greste said Monday that his freedom was something of a \\'rebirth\" and that key to his well-being while incarcerated for more than a year was exercising, studying and meditating. Greste poses for a photograph in Kibati village, in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in August 2013. Al-Jazeera English producer Baher Mohamed, left, Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy, center, and correspondent Greste, right, appear in court in March 2014. Greste said he is now looking forward to \"watching a few sunsets and the stars\" and \"feeling the sand under my toes\". Fahmy\\'s relatives expect the Canadian-Egyptian to also be deported under a decree passed by Egypt\\'s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi that allows for the transfer of foreigners on trial. Canada said Greste\\'s release was positive and it remained \\'very hopeful\\' Fahmy would be freed soon. Al Jazeera also vowed to pursue the campaign to free its other two journalists. But Heather Allan, head of newsgathering at the channel, admitted she wasn\\'t confident Mohamed, an Egyptian, would be released. \\'(But) are we going to keep on fighting it? Absolutely,\\' she said. \\'We are not going to leave him there.\\' Mohamed\\'s family has pinned their hopes on a presidential pardon or his acquittal on appeal. The journalists were arrested in late 2013 for allegedly aiding the black-listed Muslim Brotherhood.\\nA: Highlights: Peter Greste said it was hard to leaving his colleagues in a Cairo prison.

The USS Hampton appears in an undated photograph. Cmdr. Michael B. Portland lost his post \"due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command,\" the Navy said in a statement. Cmdr. William J. Houston will replace Portland. The crew neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of chemical levels associated with the cooling system of the ship\\'s nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. The crew then went back and falsified existing records to make it appear the work had been done. \"There is not, and never was, any danger to the crew or the public,\" the Navy said. Portland\\'s demotion brings to 10 the number of people relieved of duty on the submarine in the wake of the misconduct probe. Six personnel have been punished for forging inspection records for the cooling system, the Navy officials said Monday. Those six -- one officer and five enlisted personnel -- received a \"nonjudicial punishment\" after other Navy personnel discovered their actions, the officials said. The Navy said Friday that one officer and two enlisted crew members have been temporarily reassigned to Submarine Squadron 11. Portland also will be temporarily reassigned to that squadron. The misconduct was discovered September 17 but not made public until after completion of an initial inquiry. A fact-finding investigation is under way, and further action against Navy crew members is possible, a Navy official said. The Hampton remains in port in San Diego, California. In all, the $900 million vessel\\'s crew includes 13 officers and 116 enlisted personnel. E-mail to a friend.\\nA:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Q: Oral dissolution therapy involves regularly taking medication to dissolve the gallstones causing your biliary colic. While oral dissolution therapy is occasionally effective, it\\'s usually not recommended by doctors because of the likelihood that the gallstones will return once treatment is stopped. This procedure is done by inserting a tube into your bile duct to remove a blockage, such as gallstones. You will be under general anaesthetic during the procedure, which can take up to 4 hours. This procedure has minimal risks and requires 1-2 weeks of recovery. This procedure can often reduce pain caused by a biliary colic issue. However, you will need to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle to ensure the issue does not return. Lithotripsy is a procedure in which ultrasound waves are used to break up the gallstones causing biliary colic pain. Lithotripsy is usually reserved for people who have chronic biliary colic pain and cannot have their gallbladder surgically removed.\\nA: Talk to your doctor about oral dissolution therapy. Ask your doctor about getting biliary drainage done to reduce the pain. Talk to your doctor about lithotripsy if you\\'re unable to undergo surgery.\\n\\nArticle: Write it down or speak it aloud to help you process your worries. For instance, you might be afraid of saying the wrong thing or looking silly. Be as specific as possible about what’s making you nervous. Common worries include being judged, making a mistake, not measuring up, or making a bad impression. Ask yourself how likely your fear is to come true. Then, imagine how your speech is likely to go. Think of the positive things that could happen. This should help you realize that your worries are unlikely to come true.  For example, let\\'s say you\\'re worried that you will forget what you have to say. You could remind yourself that you know your topic well and will have your note card with you to refresh your memory, if you need it. Then, picture yourself using the note card during your speech. If the thing you\\'re afraid of has actually happened to you, ease your fear by thinking about what you\\'ve done to prevent it from happening again. For instance, remind yourself that you\\'ve been thoroughly preparing for the speech and that you\\'ve practiced. It may feel like the audience is there to judge you, but this isn’t true. Your audience is there to hear what you have to say and learn something they can use. They want you to do a good job, so they’re on your side. Think of them as supporters. Think about how you feel when you go to see someone speak. Are you hoping they’ll do a bad job? Do you look for mistakes or judge how nervous they look? Probably not. Walk through the room and introduce yourself to people. Try to meet as many people as you can. This will help you feel like one of the group, which will make you feel less worried.  You might stand by the door as people come in to greet them. Don’t worry if you don’t meet everyone. You may feel more confident during your speech if you make eye contact with the people you met beforehand. However, this isn\\'t necessary.\\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\\nList off the specific worries that are causing your fear. Challenge your worries by listing the probable outcomes. Remind yourself that the audience wants you to succeed. Mingle with your audience before your speech to reduce your fear.\\n\\nProblem: Article: Go to https://www.facebook.com/ in your browser.

If you are accustomed to using a riding lawnmower because of the size of your lawn, divide your lawn into sections and mow each section on separate days. Use a shovel instead of a snow blower. Use a rake instead of a leaf blower. Wash your car yourself versus taking it through the car wash. You can’t help but dance to it. Slow dancing burns approximately 3 to 4 calories a minute, and fast dancing burns about 8 calories a minute. If you dance while doing the housework, you’ll be in the mid-range of about 5 calories a minute. So dance your way to a smaller butt and thighs while getting your housework done more quickly. You do this is by building up a set of habits over the years that help you stay fit without putting in a ton of effort. This happens overtime by making good lifestyle choices. Pick weekend activities that keep you moving like hiking and bicycling. Don’t be a couch potato. Overall, sitting for too long is not good. Basically this means that whenever you can, get up and move. All the way around, sitting on a ball is much better for you. It requires good posture, and unlike sitting in an office chair, you can’t slouch. Also sitting on a ball activates the core muscles of your back, hips and abdomen. When one part of your body gets in shape, it means that the other parts of your body, like your butt and thighs, receive benefit, too. This is a perfect investment if you don’t like to exercise. You can wear it when you’re cleaning the house or washing the car. A vest gives you an additional 20 pounds of weight to hold. You can even just walk around wearing it for 30 minutes a day. It will help you build muscle and burn calories, all without exercising.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Look for more action-oriented ways to do your chores. Do your housework to energetic songs that you love. Be that person that doesn’t try to stay in shape. Replace your office chair with a stability ball. Wear a weighted vest around your torso.\\n\\nQ: Once the installer has finished downloading, head to your default download folder, most likely called Downloads.

This second game of a Monday Night Football doubleheader marked the first time the Chargers had shutout the Raiders since a 44-0 win in 1961. LaDainian Tomlinson led the Chargers with 31 carries for 131 yards, while Philip Rivers, in his debut as an NFL starting quarterback, completed 8 of 11 pass attempts for 108 yards with one touchdown pass and no interceptions. The Chargers' defense stifled the Raiders' running game, holding Raiders RB Lamont Jordan to 20 yards on 10 carries, and recorded 9 quarterback sacks against Raiders QBs Aaron Brooks and Andrew Walter. Three of those sacks belonged to second-year LB Shawne Merriman. With the win, the Chargers extended their winning streak against Oakland to six games, while head coach Marty Schottenheimer improved his head coaching record against the Raiders to 26-7. Schottenheimer also earned his 187th career victory, passing Chuck Knox to become the seventh-winning-est head coach in NFL history. That shutout also marked the second time ever that Oakland had been shut out in their own stadium, the second being the Denver Broncos and the third being the St. Louis Rams as the Chargers picked up their 6th straight win over the Raiders and started their season 1-0.\\nHow many times did the Chargers sack the Raiders?\\n\\nA: 9\\n\\n\\nP: Coming off their season-sweep over the Browns, the Ravens flew to Reliant Stadium for a Week 10 duel with the Houston Texans.

Week 10 was originally set to be the team's bye week. This contest would be the eighth of a record fifteen consecutive games for the Ravens. In the first quarter, Baltimore took flight as rookie quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 43-yard TD pass to WR Yamon Figurs.  In the second quarter, the Texans responded with a 23-yard field goal by kicker Kris Brown.  The Ravens would punt on the ensuing drive, pinning the Texans at their 3-yard line.   On the next play, Texans OT Duane Brown committed a holding penalty while in his own endzone, giving the Ravens a safety.  Baltimore would increase their lead as rookie kicker Steven Hauschka got a 54-yard field goal.  The Texans would close out the half as Brown nailed a 48-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Ravens increased their lead as RB Willis McGahee got a 1-yard TD run.  Houston would answer as quarterback Sage Rosenfels completed a 60-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Walter.  In the fourth quarter, Baltimore steamrolled their way to victory with Flacco completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Todd Heap (with a 2-point conversion pass to WR Derrick Mason), QB Troy Smith completing a 14-yard TD pass to Heap, and McGahee rushing four yards for a TD.\\nAnswer this: Who threw more touchdown passes, Flacco or Smith?\\n\\nA: Flacco\\n\\n\\nProblem: Coming off their divisional road win over the Lions, the Bears flew to the Georgia Dome for a Week 6 duel with the Atlanta Falcons.

Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.\\n\\nQuestion: In what year did Emperor Wu of Han's reign end?\\nAns: 87 BC\\nHere is a question about this article: On Earth, 99% of glacial ice is contained within vast ice sheets in the polar regions, but glaciers may be found in mountain ranges on every continent except Australia, and on a few high-latitude oceanic islands. Between 35°N and 35°S, glaciers occur only in the Himalayas, Andes, Rocky Mountains, a few high mountains in East Africa, Mexico, New Guinea and on Zard Kuh in Iran. Glaciers cover about 10 percent of Earth's land surface. Continental glaciers cover nearly 13,000,000 km2 (5×10^6 sq mi) or about 98 percent of Antarctica's 13,200,000 km2 (5.1×10^6 sq mi), with an average thickness of 2,100 m (7,000 ft). Greenland and Patagonia also have huge expanses of continental glaciers.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: How much of Earth's land surface do glaciers cover?\\n****\\nSo... about 10 percent\\nThe problem: Answer a question about this article:\\nOften, large multinational corporations exhibit vertical integration, participating in a broad range of drug discovery and development, manufacturing and quality control, marketing, sales, and distribution. Smaller organizations, on the other hand, often focus on a specific aspect such as discovering drug candidates or developing formulations. Often, collaborative agreements between research organizations and large pharmaceutical companies are formed to explore the potential of new drug substances.

To deal with inconsistencies in regulations among countries, delegates to a conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization adopted an International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 to create voluntary standards of pesticide regulation for different countries. The Code was updated in 1998 and 2002. The FAO claims that the code has raised awareness about pesticide hazards and decreased the number of countries without restrictions on pesticide use.\\nHow recently were voluntary standards of pesticide regulation updated?\\nA: 2002\\nQuestion: Read this and answer the question\\n\\nThe new peace would only last for two years; war recommenced in the aftermath of John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John accomplished this by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this. It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.[nb 5]\\n\\nJohn acquired key land between Poitou and where?\\nAnswer:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden\\'s presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the  Bin Laden family.\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the  Bin Laden family, about Usama\\'s inheritance. \\n\\nQuestion: \"During the two trips taken to the Persian Gulf, the NSC spoke to officials from what country?\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer: \"United Arab Emirates\"\\n\\nResponse: no\\n\\n\\nLiving things need non-living matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any non-living matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 3.11. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats. \\n\\nQuestion: \"Name living or nonliving things that uses energy\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer: \"Space\"\\n\\nResponse: no\\n\\n\\nGrowing up on a farm near St. Paul, L. Mark Bailey didn\\'t dream of becoming a judge. Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor\\'s degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O\\'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \"This award came as a real surprise to me. It is truly an honor. Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling. \\n\\nQuestion: \"More then 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present at what event?\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer: \"Indian Chief dinner\"\\n\\nResponse: no\\n\\n\\nTropical climates are found around the equator. These climates have warm temperatures year round. Tropical climates may be very wet or wet and dry. Tropical wet climates occur at or very near the equator. They have high rainfall year round. Tropical rainforests grow in this type of climate. Tropical wet and dry climates also occur near the equator. They receive less rainfall. Most of the rain falls in a single season. The rest of the year is dry. Few trees can withstand the long dry season. The main plants are grasses. Dry climates receive very little rainfall. They also have high rates of evaporation. This makes them even drier. Deserts can get less than 25 centimeters of rain per year. Thats less than 10 inches per year.

       "    'content': 'In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Herbs and vegetables that you grow at home without using pesticides and synthetic fertilizers are considered organic. To ensure that your garden is organic, use 100% organic seeds and natural fertilizers like compost to grow the herbs and vegetables. To save the most money, grow the herbs and vegetables that you use the most in your cooking.  You can purchase 100% organic seeds online or from your local plant nursery. You can also find natural fertilizers at your local plant nursery. You can grow herbs and vegetables in old milk jugs and bean cans on your porch or window sills. Foods that have a long shelf life include potatoes, onions, pulses, dried foods, and pastas. Buy food for 1 to 2 months. This will enable you to cut the cost of buying organically by a significant amount. If you are buying food for 1 to 2 months, preserve perishable food, like produce and meat, by freezing it. Put the food in a resealable bag or airtight container and place it in the freezer. Store perishable foods for up to 1 month in the freezer. Store semi-perishables like potatoes and onions in the freezer for up to 6 months. Frozen organic produce is typically cheaper than fresh produce. And even though it is cheaper, it is still as healthy as fresh produce. Look for organic produce in the frozen food section at your grocery store. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) has created a list of produce called the “dirty dozen.” These fruits and vegetables are at risk of being grown with a high amount of pesticides. If you are on a budget, at least buy the organic versions of the “dirty dozen.”  Produce included in the list are peaches, strawberries, apples, grapes, spinach, celery, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and imported sweet peas and nectarines. The EWG is an environmental organization based in the U.S. that specializes in advocacy and research in relation to governmental subsidies, toxic chemicals, corporate accountability, and public lands. Seasonal produce is typically cheaper, whether it is organic or not. Buy produce that is in season to reduce the cost of buying organic produce.  Fruits and vegetables in season during the fall are acorn squash, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, garlic, pears, pineapples, and crab apples. Fruits and vegetables in season during the winter are clementines, grapefruit, kiwi, sweet potatoes, collard greens, and buttercup squash. Fruits and vegetables in season during the spring are artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, corn, spinach, mangoes, pineapple, peas, and strawberries. Fruits and vegetables in season during the summer are cucumbers, bell peppers, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, eggplant, green beans, tomatoes, and okra.\\nSummary: Grow your own herbs and vegetables. Buy food that has a long shelf life in bulk. Store perishable foods in the freezer. Check out frozen organic produce. Buy the organic versions of produce that are high in pesticides. Stick to seasonal produce.\\n\\nThis usually includes rulers, yardsticks, or measuring tape. The size of whatever you’re measuring will determine which measuring tool is best for you.  For example, use a measuring stick if you’re trying to measure the length of something with a rigid straight edge. Rulers are best for short distances, while yard sticks are better for objects that are 1 to 3 feet (0.30 to 0.91\\xa0m) long. Use a tape measure when you need to measure the distance around a curved object. Tape measures can bend, making them better for objects that are not perfectly flat or straight. Count the number of small lines in between the bigger, numbered lines on your measuring tool. Since each of the numbered lines represents an inch, the number of lines in between them determines how your tool breaks inches down into fractions.  If there is 1 unnumbered line, the inches are broken down into halves. If there are 3 unnumbered lines, the inches are broken down into quarters. If there are 7 unnumbered lines, the inches are broken down into eighths. If there are 15 unnumbered lines, the inches are broken down into sixteenths. Place the starting end of the measuring tool where it says “0” against the closest edge of the object or distance you’re trying to measure. Make sure the starting edge of the measuring tool and the edge of the object are perfectly aligned in order to get an accurate measurement. If the starting edge of your tool is not marked with a “0,” you can also identify it by locating the number “1” on the tool. The end that comes just before the “1” mark on your measuring tool is the “0” end. Bring the measuring tool out along the length of the object as far as it can go. Keep the tool parallel to this length the entire way in order to ensure your measurement is accurate.  When using a measuring stick, the stick should lie flat against the edge or line being measured. When using measuring tape, the tape should wrap around the entire distance being measured. This is the last numbered value represented on the measuring tool before it reaches the opposite end of the line, edge, or distance being measured. This numbered value is the number of whole inches in the length that you’re measuring. The numbered values on a ruler, yardstick, or measuring tape all correspond to whole inches. The shorter, unnumbered lines in between the numbered values are fractions of an inch. Identify the unnumbered line on the measuring tool that lands at the exact end of the distance being measured. Then, count the unnumbered lines in between the measured whole inch value and that final line, including the final line itself. This will give you the final measurement in inches of whatever you’re trying to measure. Be sure you’ve already determined how your measuring tool has divided inches into fractions before doing this.  For example, if the object you’re measuring stops on the fifth of 7 unnumbered lines after the “3” mark, then the length of the object is 3 inches plus 5/8 of an inch. If the end of the edge lands on a numbered line, there is no additional fraction to add on.\\n++++++++++\\nOne-sentence summary -- Be sure to choose a measuring tool that measures in inches. Note how your measuring tool divides inches into fractions. Line up the start of your tool with 1 end of whatever you’re measuring. Extend the measuring tool down the object you’re measuring. Identify the last full inch your tool is measuring on the object. Count the unnumbered lines past the previous full inch value. Add the fractions you just counted to the full inch value.\\n\\nProblem: Article: While punks in the 80s used crazy products like glue and starch to keep their mohawks solid, there are plenty of sprays nowadays that won’t damage your hair. Use a hair spray with a tagline like “concrete”, “frozen”, or “solid”, or with a description of extreme styles with height. To make the tips of your spikes pointier and resistant to fraying, grab a gel as well. Again, look for \"max hold\" or \"freezing\" gels. Hairspray will form the basis of the hold for you style, but gel is only for the tips of your liberty spikes or outside edge of your mohawk. While gel gives a lot of hold to shorter styles, it\\'s too heavy to use as a main product, and will cause your mohawk or liberty spikes to fall over.\\nSummary:'},\n",

If you\\'re going to apply liquid soap, you need to apply approximately 0.068 ounces (2 mL) to the stem of each plant and tree. Count the number of trees and plants within the area you need to protect and multiply the number by 0.068 (ounces) or 2 (mL) to get the amount of liquid soap required. If you count 25 trees and plants total, you need 1.7 ounces (50.28 mL) of liquid soap. This is derived from animal fatty acids and is the repellent. Go to your local grocery or drugstore and find the personal hygiene section. Locate bar soap or liquid soap and make sure the ingredients list contains tallow (also known as sodium tallowate). Depending on the extent of your deer problem, you may want to purchase bulk packages to save money.  Always select the strongest scent possible to increase the soap\\'s deterrent effect. Don\\'t use soaps that contain coconut oils—they might attract deer. Most soaps have ingredients that can either damage soil or alter its pH of and destabilize the environment for plants. Try to avoid soaps with salt and sodium compounds, boron, chlorine bleach, and alkaline compounds. Don\\'t worry if some of these ingredients are present—just do your best to avoid as many as possible.\\nA: Determine how much bar soap you need. Calculate how much liquid soap you need. Purchase bar or liquid soap that contains tallow. Avoid soaps that contain soil-affecting ingredients.\\n\\nQ: If you’re supposed to be somewhere, aim to be there right on time. It is better to be early than late. If you know you might run into traffic or other obstacles, leave early to give yourself extra time.  Being punctual is one of the best ways to show that you are dependable. Even being just a few minutes late can send the wrong message. Set alarms on your phone to wake you up in the morning or to remind you when you need to leave. If you know you need a lot of time in the morning to get ready, make sure that you wake up early enough to get it done. If you receive an email, phone call, text message, or letter, read it and respond to it within 24 hours. By doing so, you\\'ll make sure that they get the proper response and that you don\\'t forget to reply to important matters.  If someone calls and you’re not available, try sending them an email or text message asking if you can call them back later. Set aside 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon to answer all of your emails. This will help you answer them if you are busy throughout the day. Occasionally making a mistake doesn’t mean that you are not reliable. Just make sure that you accept responsibility for all of your mistakes and offer to fix them as soon as possible.  For example, if you promised to pick up groceries on the way home and forgot, you might offer to go back out and get them. If you made an error on a document at work, tell your boss that you will fix it right away. Whether you’re helping your friend assemble a TV stand or preparing a presentation at work, always do your best work. Go above and beyond if possible to show that you can perform good work consistently. For example, if you are helping someone put up pictures on their wall, take the time to measure out the space and to level out each frame. Don’t just put a nail in the wall and walk away. It’s hard to be dependable when you’ve taken on too many responsibilities for one person to handle. Don’t be afraid to ask friends, family, or coworkers for help when you’re feeling overwhelmed. For example, you might say to your spouse, “Can you pick up the kids from school today? I promised my boss I would get this report done by the end of the day, so I may need to work a little late.” Changing your habits takes time and commitment. In order to change your habits permanently, you will need to keep at it over a long period of time. Studies show that, on average, it takes 66 days of daily, persistent effort to change a habit. It’s likely that you’ll have setbacks along the way, and that’s ok—just try to identify what caused the setback, so that you can avoid it happening again.\\nA: Show up on time. Respond to emails and messages quickly. Fix your mistakes in a timely manner. Deliver good work every time. Delegate tasks, when you need to. Be patient with yourself.\\n\\nQ: Most wild-caught females have already mated and are capable of laying eggs. If you catch one, you could coax her to lay eggs.  For butterflies, set them up in a cage with a water bottle and host clippings next to the light source (preferably sunlight). This will encourage her to oviposit. You may also want to keep her in a dark, cool area for a couple of days to help her acclimate to her new surroundings.  Moths are much easier than butterflies. If you catch an adult female moth, you can simply place her in a large paper bag, fold it up, and leave her there for a couple of days. She\\'ll likely deposit eggs on the inside of the bag. Tear the bag, removing the eggs without touching them, and place them into a more suitable container. Since monarch butterflies are so popular, there are Monarch farms where you can order monarch caterpillars, like from Monarch Watch. They can ship the little critters to you unharmed. The only drawback to this is that you still have to find their food, the Milkweed. If it\\'s not in your area, you\\'ll have to order or grow it to successfully raise the Monarch. If you cannot find caterpillars in your yard or it\\'s just the wrong time of year (it varies by locale), there are \"caterpillar suppliers\" for just this reason. Most companies have a wide variety of species to choose from and you know just what you\\'ll end up with. Painted Ladies are probably the easiest, as you can just buy growth medium for them to feast on. However, this is a little less exciting then finding then on your own and knowing what they really like to eat. If you can, spend some time scoping out your garden. Exhaust all possibilities before you turn to the caterpillar farm.\\nA: Consider catching an adult female. Visit a monarch farm. Buy caterpillars from a supplier.\\n\\nQ: The measurements don\\'t have to be exact. If you are using fresh lime juice, you will need about half a lime. If the drink is too sweet for you, you can add a little bit more lime juice. If the drink is not sweet enough, you can add more sugar. You can also use sugar packets. Each sugar packet contains about 1 teaspoon of sugar. Some people find that this is a good remedy for hangovers.\\nA:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: Lillian Evelyn Moller Gilbreth (May 24, 1878 - January 2, 1972) was an American psychologist, industrial engineer, consultant, and educator who was an early pioneer in applying psychology to time-and-motion studies. She was described in the 1940s as \"a genius in the art of living.\" Gilbreth, one of the first female engineers to earn a Ph.D., is considered to be the first industrial/organizational psychologist.\\n\\nLillie Evelyn Moller was born in Oakland, California, on May 24, 1878, to Annie (Delger) and William Moller, a builder\\'s supply merchant. She was the second of the family\\'s eleven children. Both of her wealthy parents were of German descent. Educated at home until the age of nine, Moller began formal schooling in the first grade at a public elementary school and was rapidly promoted through the grade levels. She was elected vice president of her senior class at Oakland High School and graduated with exemplary grades in May 1896.  Moller, who changed her name to Lillian during college, continued her education at the University of California, Berkeley, commuting by streetcar from her parents\\' Oakland home. She graduated from the university in 1900, earning a teaching certificate and a bachelor\\'s degree in English literature, and was the school\\'s first female commencement speaker at the university.  Moller enrolled at Columbia University, intending to pursue a master\\'s degree in literature and to study with Brander Matthews, a well-known writer and educator, but soon realized he did not allow women to study with him or attend his lectures. Following her exposure to Edward Thorndike\\'s psychology courses, she turned to Thorndike and the study of psychology because he did accept female students. After Moller became ill and returned home, she completed a master\\'s degree in literature at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1902. The topic of her thesis was Ben Jonson\\'s play Bartholomew Fair.  Moller began studies for a Ph.D. at the University of California, but took time off to travel in Europe in the spring of 1903. Following her marriage to Frank Bunker Gilbreth in 1904 and relocation to New York, she completed a dissertation for a doctorate from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1911, but was not awarded the degree due to her noncompliance with residency requirements for doctoral candidates. The dissertation was published as The Psychology of Management: The Function of the Mind in Determining, Teaching and Installing Methods of Least Waste in 1914.  After the Gilbreths relocated their family to Providence, Rhode Island, Lillian enrolled at Brown University. She earned a Ph.D. in applied psychology in 1915, which mader her the first of the pioneers of industrial management to have a doctorate. The topic of her dissertation was efficient teaching methods and titled Some Aspects of Eliminating Waste in Teaching.\\n\\nWhere was she born?\\n\\nAnswer with quotes: Oakland, California,\\n\\n\\nProblem: Jean was born in Croix-des-Bouquets, Haiti. In 1982, he immigrated with his family as a thirteen-year-old boy to the United States; after living in Brooklyn, New York, they settled in East Orange and Newark, New Jersey. He began to make music as a child and has cited reggae artist Bigga Haitian as one of his early influences, as well as neighborhood heroes MC Tiger Paw Raw and producer Lobster v. Crab. His mother recognized his musical talent and bought him a guitar when he was in his teens; he played music to earn respect.\\n\\nJean announced plans to begin a solo career with 1997\\'s Wyclef Jean Presents the Carnival Featuring the Refugee All-Stars (generally called The Carnival). The album\\'s guests included Lauryn Hill and Pras along with Jean\\'s siblings\\' group Melky Sedeck; the I Threes (back-up vocals for Bob Marley); The Neville Brothers and Celia Cruz. The album was a hit, as were two singles: \"We Trying to Stay Alive\" (adapted from the Bee Gees\\' \"Stayin\\' Alive\") and \"Gone Till November\" (recorded with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra).  Released in 2000, Jean\\'s second solo album The Ecleftic: 2 Sides II a Book was recorded with guests including Youssou N\\'Dour; Earth, Wind & Fire; Kenny Rogers; The Rock; and Mary J. Blige. With Blige he released \"911\" as a single. He was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Act at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards.  Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Jean participated in the benefit concert America: A Tribute to Heroes contributing a cover of the Bob Marley song \"Redemption Song\". His third album, Masquerade, was released in 2002. His fourth album, The Preacher\\'s Son, was released in November 2003 as the follow-up to his first solo album, The Carnival. In 2004, he released his fifth album, Sak Pase Presents: Welcome to Haiti (Creole 101) (released in the United States by Koch Records). Most of its songs are in his native language of Haitian Creole like \"Fanm Kreyol\" with the French Caribbean Admiral T. He also figured on the album Mozaik Kreyol of this one in the song \"Secret Lover\". Then he covered Creedence Clearwater Revival\\'s song \"Fortunate Son\" for the soundtrack of the 2004 film remake of The Manchurian Candidate and wrote the song \"Million Voices\" for the film Hotel Rwanda.  Jean also produced and wrote songs for the soundtrack to Jonathan Demme\\'s 2003 documentary The Agronomist, about the Haitian activist and radio personality Jean Dominique. With Jerry \\'Wonder\\' Duplessis, Jean also composed the score of the documentary Ghosts of Cite Soleil, He helped produce the film and he appears briefly onscreen speaking by telephone in 2004 to a \"chimere\" gang-leader and aspiring rapper, Winston \"2Pac\" Jean.\\n\\nWhat songs did he write for the documentary?\\n\\nAnswer with quotes:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'IN: Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (; October 11, 1884 - November 7, 1962) was an American politician, diplomat and activist. She served as the First Lady of the United States from March 1933 to April 1945 during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt\\'s four terms in office, making her the longest serving First Lady of the United States.  Roosevelt served as United States Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952. President Harry S. Truman later called her the \"First Lady of the World\" in tribute to her human rights achievements.\\n\\nRoosevelt\\'s chief project during her husband\\'s first two terms was the establishment of a planned community in Arthurdale, West Virginia. On August 18, 1933, at Hickok\\'s urging, Roosevelt visited the families of homeless miners in Morgantown, West Virginia, who had been blacklisted following union activities. Deeply affected by the visit, Roosevelt proposed a resettlement community for the miners at Arthurdale, where they could make a living by subsistence farming, handicrafts, and a local manufacturing plant. She hoped the project could become a model for \"a new kind of community\" in the U.S., in which workers would be better cared for. Her husband enthusiastically supported the project.  After an initial, disastrous experiment with prefab houses, construction began again in 1934 to Roosevelt\\'s specifications, this time with \"every modern convenience\", including indoor plumbing and central steam heat. Families occupied the first fifty homes in June, and agreed to repay the government in thirty years\\' time. Though Roosevelt had hoped for a racially mixed community, the miners insisted on limiting membership to white Christians. After losing a community vote, Roosevelt recommended the creation of other communities for the excluded black and Jewish miners. The experience motivated Roosevelt to become much more outspoken on the issue of racial discrimination.  Roosevelt remained a vigorous fundraiser for the community for several years, as well as spending most of her own income on the project. However, the project was criticized by both the political left and right. Conservatives condemned it as socialist and a \"communist plot\", while Democratic members of Congress opposed government competition with private enterprise. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes also opposed the project, citing its high per-family cost. Arthurdale continued to sink as a government spending priority for the federal government until 1941, when the U.S. sold off the last of its holdings in the community at a loss.  Later commentators generally described the Arthurdale experiment as a failure. Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit in which she felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a \"utopia\" compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people\\'s lives there and stating, \"I don\\'t know whether you think that is worth half a million dollars. But I do.\"\\n\\nwere the people of Arthurdale grateful to her?\\n\\nOUT: However, the residents considered the town a \"utopia\" compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency.\\nAnswer the question at the end by quoting:\\n\\nJohn William Heisman (October 23, 1869 - October 3, 1936) was a player and coach of American football, baseball, and basketball, as well as a sportswriter and actor. He served as the head football coach at Oberlin College, Buchtel College (now known as the University of Akron), Auburn University, Clemson University, Georgia Tech, the University of Pennsylvania, Washington & Jefferson College, and Rice University, compiling a career college football record of 186-70-18. In 1917, Heisman\\'s Georgia Tech Golden Tornado were recognized as the national champion. Heisman was also the head basketball coach at Georgia Tech, tallying a mark of 9-14, and the head baseball coach at Buchtel, Clemson, and Georgia Tech, amassing a career college baseball record of 199-108-7.\\nHeisman was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954, a member of the second class of inductees. Heisman was an innovator and \"master strategist\". He developed one of the first shifts. He was a proponent of the legalization of the forward pass. He had both his guards pull to lead an end run and had his center snap the ball. He invented the hidden ball play, and originated the \"hike\" or \"hep\" shouted by the quarterback to start each play. He led the effort to cut the game from halves to quarters. He is credited with the idea of listing downs and yardage on the scoreboard, and of putting his quarterback at safety on defense.  On December 10, 1936, just two months after Heisman\\'s death on October 3, the Downtown Athletic Club trophy was renamed the Heisman Memorial Trophy, and is now given to the player voted as the season\\'s most outstanding collegiate football player. Voters for this award consist primarily of media representatives, who are allocated by regions across the country in order to filter out possible regional bias, and former recipients. Following the bankruptcy of the Downtown Athletic Club in 2002, the award is now given out by the Heisman Trust.  Heisman Street on Clemson\\'s campus is named in his honor. Heisman Drive, located directly south of Jordan-Hare Stadium on the Auburn University campus, is named in his honor as well. A bust of him is also in Jordan-Hare Stadium. A wooden statue of Heisman was placed at the Rhinelander-Oneida County Airport. A bronze statue of him was placed on Akron\\'s campus. Heisman has also been the subject of a musical.\\n\\nDid he break any football records?\\n\\n\\ninput: The Soul Giants were formed in 1964. In 1964, Frank Zappa was approached by Ray Collins who asked him to take over as the guitarist following a fight between Collins and the group\\'s original guitarist. Zappa accepted, and convinced the other members that they should play his music to increase the chances of getting a record contract. Original leader David Coronado did not think that the band would be employable if they played original material, and left the band. Zappa soon assumed leadership and the role as co-lead singer, even though he never considered himself a singer.  The band was renamed the Mothers, coincidentally on Mother\\'s Day. The group increased their bookings after beginning an association with manager Herb Cohen, while they gradually gained attention on the burgeoning Los Angeles underground music scene. In early 1966, they were spotted by leading record producer Tom Wilson when playing Zappa\\'s \"Trouble Every Day,\" a song about the Watts Riots. Wilson had earned acclaim as the producer for singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and the folk-rock act Simon & Garfunkel, and was notable as one of the few African Americans working as a major label pop music producer at this time.  Wilson signed the Mothers to the Verve Records division of MGM Records, which had built up a strong reputation in the music industry for its releases of modern jazz recordings in the 1940s and 1950s, but was attempting to diversify into pop and rock audiences. Verve insisted that the band officially rename themselves because \"Mother\" in slang terminology was short for \"motherfucker\"--a term that apart from its profanity, in a jazz context connotes a very skilled musical instrumentalist. The label suggested the name \"The Mothers Auxiliary\", which prompted Zappa to come up with the name \"The Mothers of Invention\".\\n\\nAnswer this question \"What made them significant in the early years?\"\\noutput:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Some context: Lillian Evelyn Moller Gilbreth (May 24, 1878 - January 2, 1972) was an American psychologist, industrial engineer, consultant, and educator who was an early pioneer in applying psychology to time-and-motion studies. She was described in the 1940s as \"a genius in the art of living.\" Gilbreth, one of the first female engineers to earn a Ph.D., is considered to be the first industrial/organizational psychologist.\\nFor more than forty years, Gilbreth\\'s career combined psychology with the study of scientific management and engineering. She also included her perspectives as a wife and mother in her research, writing, and consulting work. Gilbreth became a pioneer in what is now known as Industrial and organizational psychology. She helped industrial engineers recognized the importance of the psychological dimensions of work. In addition, she became the first American engineer ever to create a synthesis of psychology and scientific management. (Gilbreth introduced the concept of using psychology to study management at the Dartmouth College Conference on Scientific Management in 1911.)  In addition to jointly running Gilbreth Incorporated, their business and engineering consulting firm, Lillian and Frank wrote numerous publications as sole authors, as well as co-authoring multiple books and more than fifty papers on a variety of scientific topics. However, in their joint publications Lillian was not always named as a co-author, possibly due to publishers\\' concerns about a female writer. Althhough her credentials included a doctorate in psychology, she is less frequently credited in their joing publications than her husband, who did not attend college.  The Gilbreths were certain that the revolutionary ideas of Frederick Winslow Taylor would be neither easy to implement nor sufficient; their implementation would require hard work by engineers and psychologists to make them successful. The Gilbreths also believed that scientific management as formulated by Taylor fell short when it came to managing the human element on the shop floor. The Gilbreths helped formulate a constructive critique of Taylorism; this critique had the support of other successful managers.\\nDid she have any other career highlights?\\nA: she became the first American engineer ever to create a synthesis of psychology and scientific management.\\nSome context: Howard was born in Atlanta, to Dwight Sr. and Sheryl Howard, and into a family with strong athletic connections. His father is a Georgia State Trooper and serves as Athletic Director of Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, a private academy with one of the best high school basketball programs in the country, while his mother played on the inaugural women\\'s basketball team at Morris Brown College. Howard\\'s mother had seven miscarriages before he was born. A devout Christian since his youth, Howard became serious about basketball around the age of nine; when in the eighth grade, he resolved to be selected as the number one pick in the NBA Draft one day.\\nStanding at 6 feet 11 inches tall (2.11 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120 kg), Howard plays the center position. Howard led the NBA in rebounding from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2012 to 2013. Howard\\'s rebounding is in part facilitated by his extraordinary athleticism; his running vertical leap was tested at 39.5 inches in 2011, rare for a player of his size. He demonstrated this skill in the 2007 Slam Dunk Contest, where he completed an alley oop dunk from teammate Jameer Nelson while slapping a sticker onto the backboard at 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) high. The sticker showed an image of his own smiling face with a handwritten \"All things through Christ Phil: 4:13\", a paraphrase of Philippians 4:13. Howard\\'s leaping reach of 12 ft 6 in (3.81 m) is the highest documented in NBA history, 1 inch (2.5 cm) higher than Shaquille O\\'Neal\\'s previous record of 12 ft 5 in (3.78 m). As of April 2013, Howard\\'s career average of 12.9 rebounds per game (in the regular season) ranked 12th in NBA history.  Howard\\'s abilities and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: \"[Howard] is so developed... He has so much promise and I am glad that I will be out of the league when he is peaking.\" Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: \"[Howard] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn\\'t that gifted, as far as body and physical presence.\" Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: \"It\\'s like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they\\'re going to have to change the rules.\" As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA.  While many sports pundits have been rating Howard as one of the top young prospects in the NBA since 2006, Howard has some weaknesses in his game. Offensively, his shooting range remains limited; he is also mistake-prone, having led the NBA in total number of turnovers in the 2006-07 season. Like many centers, he has a low free throw conversion percentage. As a result, he is often a target of the Hack-a-Shaq defense and is annually among the league leaders in free throw attempts. During the 2007-08 regular season, Howard led the NBA with 897 free throw attempts while shooting only 59% from the free throw line. Also in that season, outside of layups and dunks, his shooting percentage was only 31.6%. In the 2008-09 season, he led the NBA again with 849 free throw attempts and in 2009-10, he was second in the NBA with 816.\\nWhat did he do during the slam dunk contest?\\nA:'},\n",

Kilgore - who oversees delivering legal services to the disabled and elderly in 39 north Mississippi counties - is recipient of the University of Mississippi School of Law\\'s 2002 Public Service Award. The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore\\'s honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\" said Davis. \"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\" \"This award means a great deal to me,\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\" After earning bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state. She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school\\'s Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school\\'s Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she\\'s found her niche. \"I\\'ve always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it. The issues I\\'ve dealt with through the years have been on the side of helping people maintain the basics of life - home, healt h care, jobs and family.\" She says her desire to serve others was sparked early, growing up in a single-parent home, aware that her widowed mother faced certain challenges as she supported her four children through public school and college. \\n\\nWho entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978?\\n\\n\\nRakal, her first officer, was staring pensively at his panel. He was what this was all about. She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap out calculations on the panel. His pointed ears swiveled back and forth, catching every sound from the bridge, while his long tail swished to the rhythm of his thoughts. Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was no common \\'beta furry\\'. His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat. His eyes had been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive. Right now, he looked like an overgrown wolf who\\'d learned touch-typing. The scout ship re-emerged from the hole - a brilliant speck emerging from a sphere of velvety blackness. It\\'s hail crackled across the comm, and Tara spun to retake her seat at the helm. \"Launch the second probe. Won\\'t Central be crushed to learn that another gateway has yielded little more than a class F planet and a white dwarf system. Level 1 and 2 staffers should prepare to be briefed and move out. This sounds like it\\'s the one.\" The distinctive whuffle of pleasure rippled through the betas on the bridge, and Rakal let loose a small growl, as if to caution his charges against false hope. They\\'d scouted twenty-seven gates so far, and none had turned up anything worth the Insurrection\\'s time. Tara would not let giddy hopes drag them onto a rock that would spell the end for the project, and the Arrallin species. \\n\\n'},\n",

Rising government spending in the 1960s, however, led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility, gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold, and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline. Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold, gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon, resulting in the \"Nixon shock\".\\n\\nWhen was the Bretton Woods system established?\\nOutput: after World War II\\n\\nInput: Canadian Armed Forces\\nThe Canadian Rangers, who provide surveillance and patrol services in Canada\\'s arctic and other remote areas, are an essential reserve force component used for Canada\\'s exercise of sovereignty over its northern territory.\\n\\nWhere do the Canadian Rangers operate?\\nOutput: in Canada\\'s arctic\\n\\nInput: PlayStation 3\\nOn September 6, 2006, Sony announced that PAL region PlayStation 3 launch would be delayed until March 2007, because of a shortage of materials used in the Blu-ray drive.

Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a \"general scholar\" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge.\\n\\nWhat type of epistemology served as the foundation of knowledge constructions and  training scholars in universities?\\nOutput:'},\n",

In 1984, this club was taken over by Liverpool F.C. player Tommy Smith and rebuilt with bricks from the original Cavern club. The new design was to resemble the original as closely as possible. This was a period of massive economic and political change in and around Liverpool and the club only survived until 1989, when it came under financial pressures and closed for 18 months. In 1991, two friends--schoolteacher Bill Heckle and taxi driver Dave Jones--reopened it. They still run the club today and are now the longest-running owners in its history. The club continues to function primarily as a live music venue.

Even so, Syrian state media moved quickly to say the report of his remarks by a Russian news agency was inaccurate.\\nThis may or may not be so.  But in the game of bluff that the government and the opposition have been playing ahead of the talks, neither side wants to be seen as the obstacle to negotiation.\\nThat does not mean they are actually prepared to negotiate or compromise, but they do not want to be stigmatised as the main problem in the way of that process.\\nSo the swift rebuttal of Mr Assad\\'s latest remarks can be seen as part of this game of diplomatic poker.  The message - essentially a restatement of a long-held position - has been put out there. But it has been left open to deniability, so no blame can be put on the Assad regime for undermining the talks before they have begun.\\nOpposition groups have previously demanded the removal of Mr Assad as a condition of any discussions on a possible transitional government.\\nBut the Syrian National Coalition, the exiled opposition body, announced on Saturday that it would attend the talks.\\nThe decision was praised by the US which, with Russia and the UN, is taking a leading role in organising the negotiations.\\nThe path to the talks began in May last year when US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov agreed to try to bring both sides together.\\nLater, the UN Security Council called for a conference to implement the Geneva communique - a deal on a transitional government agreed at a UN-backed meeting in 2012.\\nDamascus agreed to take part in the talks, but said its delegation would pursue \"first and foremost eliminating terrorism\".\\nMr Assad is said to have reiterated that point of view in his talks with the Russian MPs.\\nThe BBC\\'s Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon says his reported comments underline the gaping gulf between the regime and the opposition, and are clearly not going to improve the atmosphere before the talks.\\n\\nSummarize.\\noutput: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is quoted as saying he has no intention of quitting, and the issue is not up for discussion at forthcoming peace talks.\\n\\n\\nArticle: The deal, which also includes helping island-based coaches and young players, came about through City\\'s Guernsey-based chairman Steve Lansdown.\\nGuernsey FC boss Tony Vance has had talks with City manager Lee Johnson about the possibility of bringing in players to his side.\\n\"It will benefit Guernsey football, which I\\'m excited about,\" Vance said.\\nGuernsey FC are just four points off the relegation places in the Isthmian League Division One South and often face problems being able to get enough players together to form a competitive side for away games.\\nThey have gone almost a year since their last away victory.\\nThe club has never used loan players before, with the rules of the team being that players must be based in Guernsey in order to qualify to play for the club.\\n\"It\\'s a realistic thing to do, all the other clubs do it in our league,\" Vance told BBC Radio Guernsey.\\n\"We\\'re a Guernsey football club, there\\'s no doubt about that, and I\\'ve emphasised that so much that I\\'m looking at the pathway of our players.\\n\"It won\\'t be any way detrimental to our pathway, it will enhance us.\\n\"It\\'s well documented that we struggle away from home with getting players, so they\\'re only a phone call away.\\n\"Somebody from Bristol City might be boosting our numbers, which will be much needed when I\\'ve looked at every resource possible in Guernsey.\"\\n++++++++++\\nSummarize: Guernsey FC could bring in loan players from Bristol City after agreeing a tie-up with the Championship club.\\n\\n\\nProblem: Mr Evans, 56, was chosen after a secret ballot during a meeting in Clitheroe, Lancashire, with members of the local Conservative Association.\\nHe resigned the party whip and sat as an independent MP as he fought a number of sexual offences, of which he was cleared.\\nMr Evans rejoined the party in April.\\nHe had the Conservative whip restored after a jury unanimously found him not guilty of all the allegations after a five-week trial.\\nMr Evans also stood down from his post as Deputy Commons Speaker to fight the claims.\\nHe made a statement to executive members to secure his candidacy during the meeting at the Conservative Club, where he \"spoke from the heart\".\\nSpeaking after the ballot, Mr Evans said: \"It\\'s something that I have dreamed of for a while.\\n\"To get that now means the party can be united and concentrate on winning the local elections of 2015 and of course win the General Election.\\n\"I\\'m relieved...

The Browns scored the points in the first half both of them with field goals in both quarters from Billy Cundiff from 21 yards out in the first quarter and 51 yards out in the 2nd making the score 3-0 and eventual halftime score 6-0.  The Ravens got on the board in the 3rd quarter as Bernard Pierce ran for a 5-yard TD to take the lead 7-6.  In the 4th quarter, the Ravens moved ahead by 8 as Joe Flacco found Marion Brown on a 5-yard TD pass for a final score of 14-6. With the loss, the Browns dropped to 0-2.  The team also lost their 11th straight game against the Ravens.\\n\\nQuestion: How many losses was this game for the Browns?\\n\\n\\nInput:  New England went on the road to face division rival New York in the latest meeting between the two teams at the New Meadowlands Stadium. The Jets had lost their opener to the Baltimore Ravens the previous week. The Patriots droved 51 yards in seven-and-a-half minutes to the Jets 14, but after a false-start penalty, Gostkowski missed a 37-yard field goal. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots went on a 15 play, 75-yard marathon, taking over eight minutes off the clock, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Welker early in the second quarter. After accruing no passing yards during the first quarter, the Jets marched 73 yards in 12 plays, taking just under 7 minutes off the clock, scoring on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Mark Sanchez to Braylon Edwards. Two possessions later, after two incomplete passes, Brady hit Hernandez for a 46-yard catch-and-run, then hit Moss for a 34-yard touchdown pass on an incredible one-handed catch, beating the vaunted Darrelle Revis, re-taking a 14-7 lead. The Jets answered, marching to the Patriots 31, and Nick Folk  was good on a 49-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to 14-10 at halftime. After a Jets punt, the Patriots drove to the Jets 47, but Antonio Cromartie intercepted his pass attempt for Moss at the 3. The Jets raced to the Patriots 17, and Folk was good on a 36-yard field goal, trimming the deficit to just 14-13. The Jets cashed in after a Patriots three-and-out, racing 70 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery (with a successful 2-point conversion), taking a 21-14 lead. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Cromartie intercepted another pass attempt for Moss at the Jets 41, but couldn't move the ball. After forcing the Patriots to punt, the Jets marched 63 yards in 8 plays, aided by a 23-yard pass interference penalty on Darius Butler, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown toss to Dustin Keller, widening the lead to 28-14 midway through the fourth quarter. The Patriots drove to the Jets 16, but Brady was strip-sacked by Jason Taylor with David Harris  returning it 16 yards to the Jets 41. A 3-yard run by LaDanian Tomlinson on 4th-and-1 allowed the Jets ran out the rest of the clock to win the game. With the loss, the Patriots fell to 1-1. The Jets good defense forced the Patriots into three turnovers, two Brady interceptions.\\n\\nQuestion: How many yards difference was Brady's first touchdown pass compared to his second?\\n\\n\\nInput: The Eagles returned home for a game against the Cowboys.  They scored first with Michael Vick hooking up with Riley Cooper on a 2-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead, however, the Boys responded with Tony Romo finding Felix Jones on an 11-yard pass for a 7-7 lead.  Then increased their lead in the 2nd quarter as Dan Bailey kicked a 30-yard field goal for a 10-7 halftime lead.  Michael Vick had been knocked out of the game and was possibly out for the season after going 6/9 for 70 yards and a touchdown pass.  Rookie QB Nick Foles would get his first NFL action and threw his first touchdown pass to Jeremy Maclin from 44 yards out as the Eagles retook a 14-10 lead while Henery moved the team ahead 17-10 with a 40-yard field goal.  After this, the Cowboys went back to work as Romo found Dez Bryant on a 30-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 17-17.  Then the Boys retook the lead with Dwayne Harris returned a punt 78-yards for a touchdown for a 24-17 lead followed up by Brandon Carr returning an interception 47 yards for a touchdown and a 31-17 lead.  The Eagles then got back to work with Stanley Havili 1-yard touchdown run (with a failed PAT) to shorten the lead to 31-23.  But the Boys wrapped the game up with Jason Hatcher's fumble recovery in the end zone for a final score of 38-23.\\n\\nQuestion: How many more points were the Boys leading by at the end of the game than they were at halftime?\\n\\n\\nInput: The Broncos' defense limited Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady to 188 yards passing and no touchdowns, but their defensive effort was wasted by a poor performance from their inconsistent offense. The Broncos' only scoring play was a 33-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. In the first quarter, a fumbled punt by Jordan Norwood led to a 45-yard field goal by Patriots' placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. An interception off Broncos' quarterback Trevor Siemian by cornerback Logan Ryan resulted in the only touchdown of the game&#8212;a 1-yard run by Patriots' running back LeGarrette Blount in the second quarter. Gostkowski added two more field goals&#8212;a 40-yarder in the third quarter and a 21-yarder in the fourth. The Broncos wore their alternate navy blue uniforms for this game.\\n\\nQuestion:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Question: Parliament-Funkadelic (abbreviated as P-Funk) is an American funk music collective of rotating musicians headed by George Clinton, primarily consisting of the individual bands Parliament and Funkadelic, both active since the 1960s. Their distinctive funk style drew on psychedelic culture, outlandish fashion, science-fiction, and surreal humor; it would have an influential effect on subsequent funk, post-punk, hip-hop, and post-disco artists of the 1980s and 1990s, while their collective mythology would help pioneer Afrofuturism. The collective\\'s origins date back to the doo-wop group the Parliaments, formed by Clinton in the late 1950s in Plainfield, New Jersey. Under the influence of late-1960s artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, and Frank Zappa, Clinton later relocated to Detroit and began the sister groups Parliament and Funkadelic, with the former playing an eclectic and more commercial form of funk, and the latter incorporating more influence from psychedelic rock.\\n\\nBy the late 1960s Clinton had assembled a touring band to back up the Parliaments, the first stable lineup of which included Billy Bass Nelson (bass), Eddie Hazel (lead guitarist), Tawl Ross (guitarist), Tiki Fulwood (drums), and Mickey Atkins (keyboards). After a contractual dispute in which Clinton temporarily lost the rights to the name \"The Parliaments,\" Clinton brought the backing musicians forward. When the band relocated to Detroit, their guitar-based, raw funk sound, with its heavy psychedelic rock influences, inspired \"Billy Bass\" Nelson, who coined the name \"Funkadelic\". Clinton signed Funkadelic to Westbound Records, and the five Parliaments singers were credited as \"guests\" while the five musicians were listed as the main group members. The debut album Funkadelic was released in 1970.  Meanwhile, Clinton regained the rights to the name \"The Parliaments\" and initiated another new entity, now known as Parliament, with the same five singers and five musicians but this time as a smoother R&B-based funk ensemble that Clinton positioned as a counterpoint to the more rock-oriented Funkadelic. Parliament recorded Osmium for Invictus Records in 1970, and after a hiatus in which Clinton focused on Funkadelic, Parliament was signed to Casablanca Records and released its debut for that label Up for the Down Stroke in 1974. The two bands began to tour together under the collective name \"Parliament-Funkadelic.\"  By this time the original ten-member lineup of Parliament-Funkadelic had begun to splinter, but many others joined for various album releases by either band, leading to a collective with a fluid and rapidly expanding membership. Notable members to join during this period include keyboardist Bernie Worrell, bassist Bootsy Collins, guitarist Garry Shider, and The Horny Horns.  In the 1975-1979 period, both Parliament and Funkadelic achieved several high-charting albums and singles on both the R&B and Pop charts. Many members of the collective began to branch out into side bands and solo projects under George Clinton\\'s tutelage, including Bootsy\\'s Rubber Band, Parlet, and The Brides of Funkenstein, while longtime members like Eddie Hazel recorded solo albums with songwriting and studio help from the collective. The Parliament albums of this period had become concept albums with themes from science fiction and afro-futurism, elaborate political and sociological themes, and an evolving storyline with recurring fictional characters. Parliament-Funkadelic stage shows (particularly the P-Funk Earth Tour of 1976) were expanded to include imagery from science fiction and a stage prop known as the Mothership. These concepts came to be known as the P-Funk mythology.  By the late 1970s the Parliament-Funkadelic collective became over-extended and several key members departed acrimoniously over disagreements with Clinton and his management style. Original Parliaments members Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas departed in 1977 after becoming disillusioned with the influx of new members, and later recorded an album under the name Funkadelic. Other members departed and formed new funk bands that detached themselves from P-Funk and even criticized the collective, such as Quazar (formed by guitarist Glenn Goins) and Mutiny (formed by drummer Jerome Brailey). Due to financial difficulties and the collapse of Casablanca Records (Parliament\\'s label), Clinton dissolved Parliament and Funkadelic as separate entities. Many members of the collective continued to work for Clinton, first on his solo albums and later as Parliament-Funkadelic or the P-Funk All Stars.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What kind of music did they play?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer: guitar-based, raw funk sound, with its heavy psychedelic rock influences,\\nProblem: Elena Vyacheslavovna Mukhina (Russian: Elena Viacheslavovna Mukhina; first name sometimes rendered \"Yelena\", last name sometimes rendered \"Muchina\"; June 1, 1960 - December 22, 2006) was a Soviet gymnast who won the all-around title at the 1978 World Championships in Strasbourg, France. Her career was on the rise and she was widely touted as the next great gymnastics star until in 1979 a broken leg left her out of several competitions, and the recovery from that injury combined with pressure to master a dangerous and difficult tumbling move (the Thomas salto) caused her to break her neck just two weeks before the opening of the 1980 Summer Olympics, leaving her permanently quadriplegic just one month past the age of 20.\\n\\nAccording to Larisa Latynina\\'s 2004 interview, Mukhina\\'s trainer, Mikhail Klimenko, was affected by her injury. Because of her devastating injury, Mukhina could not be added to the 1980 Soviet Olympic team roster. There was little doubt that the Soviet Olympic women\\'s gymnastics team would get the gold medal in the team competition at the 1980 Summer Olympics, as it had at all previous Olympics. Nevertheless, Klimenko had desperately wanted Mukhina to make the Olympic team roster because he wanted to become the \"Olympic champion\\'s trainer.\" Soon after Mukhina\\'s paralytic injury, Klimenko emigrated to Italy, where he lived with his children until his death from cancer on November 14, 2007, his 65th birthday.  After Mukhina\\'s paralysis and several other close calls with other Olympic-eligible female gymnasts, the Thomas salto was removed from the Code of Points as an allowed skill for women. It remained an allowed skill for men as of 2013, but as of the 2017-2020 quad, rollout skills were banned for both men and women.  Her condition notwithstanding, Mukhina was a guest columnist for Moscow News in the late 1980s. Her injury was a featured topic in the 1990 A&E documentary More Than a Game; and her World Championship performance is captured in the ABC Sports video Gymnastics\\' Greatest Stars. Mukhina took a keen interest in children and young gymnasts both before and after her injury. She also expressed a deep religious faith, and was fond of horses and animated cartoons. Mukhina was thankful to her former teammates who kept in touch with her, especially Yelena Davydova, whom she described as \"A real friend\".\\n\\nWhat was it removed?\\n\\nAnswer with quotes:'},\n",

But Josie didn\\'t have to wait for spring to get started. Six weeks before the last frost, Josie planted seeds indoors. The tiny seedlings pushed up through the soil and began to grow. Finally spring arrived. Each day, Josie moved the seedlings outside for a few hours so they could get used to the cooler temperatures. Josie worked in her garden, digging the soil.

The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that \"that would be the fourth possible hijack.\" At 9:49, the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed. At 9:59, an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley. The White House requested (1) the implementation of continuity of government measures, (2) fighter escorts for Air Force One, and (3) a fighter combat air patrol over Washington, D.C. By 10:03, when United 93 crashed in Pennsylvania, there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference. The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: \"A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack.\" The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening. The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes, while the children continued reading. He then returned to a holding room shortly before 9:15, where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage. He next spoke to Vice President Cheney, Dr. Rice, New York Governor George Pataki, and FBI Director Robert Mueller. He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport. The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location, but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door. Between 9:15 and 9:30, the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington, while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks. No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing.

The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore\\'s honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\" said Davis. \"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\" \"This award means a great deal to me,\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\" After earning bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state. She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school\\'s Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school\\'s Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she\\'s found her niche. \"I\\'ve always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it.

I never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular instance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company.  Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species.  They proved to be nothing more formidable than Mono Indians dressed in the skins of sage-rabbits.  Both the men and the women begged persistently for whisky and tobacco, and seemed so accustomed to denials that I found it impossible to convince them that I had none to give.  Excepting the names of these two products of civilization, they seemed to understand not a word of English; but I afterward learned that they were on their way to Yosemite Valley to feast awhile on trout and procure a load of acorns to carry back through the pass to their huts on the shore of Mono Lake. \\n\\nDoes the response \"Yellow\" correctly answer the question \"What color were the rabbit skins?\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Answer the question at the end by quoting:\\n\\nJudy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago\\'s work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago\\'s most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum.\\nIn 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\" She taught the first women\\'s art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.  Chicago is considered one of the \"first-generation feminist artists,\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art.  Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman\\'s Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World\\'s Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \"feminine\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women\\'s history would continue to struggle independently and collectively.\\n\\nWhat did this program do that was noteworthy?\\n\\nas the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they\\nIN: John Milton Cage Jr. (September 5, 1912 - August 12, 1992) was an American composer and music theorist. A pioneer of indeterminacy in music, electroacoustic music, and non-standard use of musical instruments, Cage was one of the leading figures of the post-war avant-garde. Critics have lauded him as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He was also instrumental in the development of modern dance, mostly through his association with choreographer Merce Cunningham, who was also Cage\\'s romantic partner for most of their lives.\\n\\nIn 2012, amongst a wide range of American and international centennial celebrations, an eight-day festival was held in Washington DC, with venues found notably more amongst the city\\'s art museums and universities than performance spaces. Earlier in the centennial year, conductor Michael Tilson Thomas presented Cage\\'s Song Books with the San Francisco Symphony at Carnegie Hall in New York. Another celebration came, for instance, in Darmstadt, Germany, which in July 2012 renamed its central station the John Cage Railway Station during the term of its annual new-music courses. At the Ruhrtriennale in Germany, Heiner Goebbels staged a production of Europeras 1 & 2 in a 36,000 sq ft converted factory and commissioned a production of Lecture on Nothing created and performed by Robert Wilson. Jacaranda Music had four concerts planned in Santa Monica, California, for the centennial week. John Cage Day was the name given to several events held during 2012 to mark the centenary of his birth.  A 2012 project was curated by Juraj Kojs to celebrate the centenary of Cage\\'s birth, titled On Silence: Homage to Cage. It consisted of 13 commissioned works created by composers from around the global such as Kasia Glowicka, Adrian Knight and Henry Vega, each being 4 minutes and 33 seconds long in honor of Cage\\'s famous 1952 opus, 4\\'33\\'\\'. The program was supported by the Foundation for Emerging Technologies and Arts, Laura Kuhn and the John Cage Trust.  In a homage to Cage\\'s dance work, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in July 2012 \"performed an engrossing piece called \\'Story/Time\\'. It was modeled on Cage\\'s 1958 work \\'Indeterminacy\\', in which [Cage and then Jones, respectively,] sat alone onstage, reading aloud ... series of one-minute stories [they]\\'d written. Dancers from Jones\\'s company performed as [Jones] read.\"\\n\\nWho else contributed or sponsored the project?\\n\\nOUT:'},\n",

The population density was 3,698 inhabitants per square mile (1,428/km²) including the airport. There were 285,797 housing units at an average density of 1,751 per square mile (676/km²). However, the average density throughout most Denver neighborhoods tends to be higher. Without the 80249 zip code (47.3 sq mi, 8,407 residents) near the airport, the average density increases to around 5,470 per square mile.Age distribution was 22.0% under the age of 18, 10.7% from 18 to 24, 36.1% from 25 to 44, 20.0% from 45 to 64, and 11.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age is 33 years. Overall there were 102.1 males for every 100 females, but in 2015 for the category of never-married ages 25 to 34, there were 121.4 males for every 100 females.

       "    'content': '(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they\\'ve often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \"It never ends,\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There\\'s a perception that California has \"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It\\'s not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America\\'s Health Rankings. \\n\\nQuestion: \"What rules exist throughout the country because of a California ban?\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer: \"Obesity Practices Ban\"\\n\\nResponse: no\\n\\n\\nRegistration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as $49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a $42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers\\' Trust Fund, which pools clients\\' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court\\'s lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \"paying full annual registration fees.\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount. This year\\'s returns are projected to be anywhere between $700,000 and $1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\" Schmitt said. \"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. \\n\\nQuestion: \"Who made the following remark: \"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\"\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer: \"Moses Schmitt,\"\\n\\nResponse: no\\n\\n\\nRenewable Energy Resource Sunlight Sunlight can be used to heat homes. It can also be used to produce electricity. This conversion is made possible by solar cells. However, solar energy may not always be practical. Some areas are just too cloudy. Example Solar panels on the roof of this house generate enough electricity to supply a familys needs. Moving Water Falling water can have a lot of energy. Its energy can be converted into kinetic energy. This energy can turn a turbine and generate electricity. The water may fall naturally over a waterfall or flow through a dam. A drawback of dams is that they flood land upstream. They can also reduce water flow downstream. Either effect may harm ecosystems. Wind Wind is moving air. It has kinetic energy that can do work. Wind turbines change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. Only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy and not very nice to look at. \\n\\nQuestion: \"What are some shortcomings of wind turbines?\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nAnswer: \"Wind turbines might not be nice to look at and they can cause fires\"\\n\\nResponse: no\\n\\n\\nCallimaco is taken by the beauty of Lucrezia , but she is the loyal wife of Nicia , a rich and foolish lawyer .

They are now reported to have increased the reward to 500,000 Egyptian pounds ($27,500; Â£22,000).\\nSo-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind both explosions.\\nEaster celebrations on Saturday night would be limited to Masses to mourn the victims of the attacks, Bishop Emmanuel Ayad of Luxor was quoted by the state-run news agency Mena as saying.\\nDecorations and the traditional handing out of sweets to children by the Coptic Pope will also be cancelled, AFP reports.\\nThe attacks on Christians, who make up about 10% of Egypt\\'s population, raised security fears ahead of a visit to Cairo by Pope Francis, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, scheduled for 28 and 29 April.\\nIn a visit to Pope Tawadros II, President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi vowed to hunt down those responsible for the bombings.\\n\\nSummarize the main points of that article.\\nAnswer:\\nEgypt\\'s Coptic Church says it will cut back Easter celebrations after the two bomb attacks that killed at least 45 people last weekend.\\n\\n\\nWell, that\\'s what we\\'ve all been told.\\nBut some scientists argue this is all a myth - and that just because we keep repeating it doesn\\'t make it true.\\nSo should we bother with breakfast?\\nStudies repeatedly show that skipping breakfast is more common in people who are overweight or obese.\\nBut this could be a dangerous trap - when the number of ice cream sales goes up so does the number of people getting sunburn. It doesn\\'t mean ice-cream is causing sunburn.\\nThis association might be down to something special about brekkie - or maybe the type of people who eat it are generally more active, have a better overall diet or try to lead healthier lives.\\nDespite advocating breakfast as part of a healthy lifestyle, a report by the UK\\'s National Obesity Observatory concluded that \"it is not clear whether there is a causal relationship with Body Mass Index (weight) or whether breakfast is merely a marker for other lifestyle factors that can contribute to healthy body weight\".\\nThe few clinical trials that have actively altered people\\'s eating habits also showed no impact on waistlines.\\nThe biggest, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, told 300 overweight or obese people to skip or eat breakfast for four months.\\n\"There was absolutely no difference whatsoever in the amount of weight-loss,\" said Prof David Allison, who conducted that trial at the University of Alabama.\\n\"With respect to weight, at least in adults, it looks like we\\'re leaning towards it [breakfast] being a myth.\"\\nHe says people who are skipping breakfast are probably just trying to control their own weight.\\nAnd one danger for skippers who start having breakfast is it could lead to weight gain, if they don\\'t eat less later in the day.\\nSo is government advice plain wrong?\\nIn Prof Allison\\'s opinion: \"If they are advising it [breakfast] for weight control then at this point it is not a justified recommendation.\"\\nDr Alison Tedstone is from one of the many organisations around the world that tells us breakfast is a good thing, and she points to studies showing people who skip breakfast tend to be bigger, which we already know is an association.\\nBut Dr Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, agrees that the \"evidence is by no means conclusive on having breakfast\".\\nHowever, she says it is the easiest meal of the day to get right, that skipping it risks snacking on something unhealthy later on and that it can be a struggle to get the right balance of nutrients without starting the day well.\\n\"It\\'s an easy meal to get a healthy meal, it\\'s an easy meal to get control over.\"\\nThere is no such thing as a perfect breakfast, but Dr Tedstone advises people to \"think fibre\" in the mornings.\\n\"Overall we\\'re not getting enough fibre in our diet and it\\'s easy to incorporate fibre into breakfast.\\n\"Take porridge - it\\'s cheap, it\\'s cheerful,\" she said.\\nAs well as porridge, high fibre breakfasts include fruit, wholegrain toast and some breakfast cereals.\\nBut some of the more palatable high-fibre cereals can be loaded with added salt and sugar.\\nProf Susan Jebb, a nutrition scientist at the University of Oxford says: \"It is very difficult, I think breakfast cereals are very challenging.\"\\nShe says it\\'s necessary to check the labels as some have less added sugar and that fresh, stewed or dried fruit could be used to make it more palatable.\\n\"I\\'d encourage people to have a piece of fruit with breakfast - much better to have fruit than fruit juice as then you get the fibre from the intact fruit.\"\\nNHS: Healthy Breakfasts\\nThe other big case made for breakfast is that it improves children\\'s performance in school.\\nA study in 2015 by the University of Cardiff was the latest to show an association between a healthy breakfast and educational performance in the classroom.\\nThese studies are now coming in for the same criticism as those that found a link between breakfast and weight.\\n\"It seems very plausible that missing breakfast as a kid is just a marker of a poor home background - that family is unable to provide breakfast for a child - which is probably the cause of them not performing well at school,\" argues Prof David Rogers at the University of Bristol.\\nSo how do we make sense of all this?\\nProf Jebb argues: \"If you\\'re currently eating breakfast I think you should make it the healthiest breakfast you can.\\n\"If you\\'re a breakfast skipper, I\\'m certainly not going to say you must eat breakfast, but I would encourage you to think about it.\"\\nWhile Prof Allison suggests people who are worried about their weight should give both eating and skipping breakfast a go to see what works best for them - just make sure you\\'re not snacking on sausage rolls by 11:00.\\nThe science behind the benefits of breakfast does not support the absolute vehemence with which it is advocated, at least in adults.\\nThat said I\\'m still going to have my bowl of breakfast cereal.\\nIt is a good start to the day for me personally otherwise I\\'m distractingly hungry.

A metal that is normally very soft and malleable, such as aluminium, can be altered by alloying it with another soft metal, like copper. Although both metals are very soft and ductile, the resulting aluminium alloy will be much harder and stronger. Adding a small amount of non-metallic carbon to iron produces an alloy called steel. Due to its very-high strength and toughness (which is much higher than pure iron), and its ability to be greatly altered by heat treatment, steel is one of the most common alloys in modern use. By adding chromium to steel, its resistance to corrosion can be enhanced, creating stainless steel, while adding silicon will alter its electrical characteristics, producing silicon steel.\\nWhat type of metal is hardly copper?\\nA:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: Write a positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) yelp review.\\nA: WTF. A Starbucks with an awesome view. Bet you the store on George Street is pissed.  W.T.F.\\n\\n\\nQ: positive\\n\\nA: Maybe one day you\\'ll find a golden ticket from Willy Wonka, then during the chocolate factory tour ingratiate yourself with the eccentric onfectionaire  and be offered a ride in his Great Glass Elevator.  But if that doesn\\'t work out, or you can\\'t wait,  $200 buys you second best: a 35 minute sunset helicopter tour of Las Vegas and the Hoover Damm by Sundance Helicopters.   The feeling of helicopter flight is as delicious as anything Willy Wonka could cook up. The desert and Hoover Dam lit by the setting sun are gorgeous, and the the Las Vegas strip viewed at night from the air no less  spectacular than an ever-lasting gobstopper. Sonny, our pilot, was knowledgeable, skillful, and as patient with the unending stream of questions from my five year old nephew as any of Wonka\\'s Oompa-Loopas could be. He even pumped our music through the copter PA.      The A-Star helicopter we rode in was smooth as silk, completely stable, nearly free of vibration and quiet enough to talk without using the provided  headsets. They also offer an upgrade to their slightly larger Eurocopter 130 for an extra $35/person.   Niggles    Willy Wonka had his flaws, and I\\'m afraid that Sundance is also not without its imperfections   * The safety video describes what to do in case of an \"unplanned preventive landing in water.\" Sorry, guys, there\\'s no prize for Best Attempted Euphemism. And it\\'s OK - you can say \"emergency landing\" or even \"ditch.\" We get this is an aircraft. * When we arrived at the terminal the front desk staff was focused on some tempest-in-a-teapot booking drama  and treated our presence as an interruption. They did better later, but for the $600 our party was spending they could have been a little more welcoming.  * There was a bit of  confusion with flight length. Their online reservations people had told me it was a 50 minute flight. The limo driver who picked us up said 30 minutes. In fact its 35 minutes, which was fine.   Hints  * There isn\\'t a bad seat in the house, but the back left (behind the pilot) is the best place to sit - it offers an extra view of Las Vegas on the outbound leg of the trip. * if you are hosting your favorite sumo wrestler, be prepared to pay extra.  They ask for your weight when taking the reservation, and then weigh everyone at check-in. On the A-Star helicopter you bust weight at  275 pounds, on the EC 130 its 300 pounds. In either case, the extra charge is $30.  * With Sundance you should reserve 4-5 days in advance. However, you can cancel up to 24 hours before flight with no penalty.  * If you want a longer flight, or are hankering to go to the Grand Canyon, Sundance offers a variety of packages in the $400-$500/person  range, all some variation on fly to the canyon by helicopter, land inside the rim, and do an activity -picnic, rafting, hiking, and then take the helicopter back. See http://www.sundancehelicopters.com/tours.aspx for details. * Don\\'t forget to tip your pilot.   Quick summary of Las Vegas air tour options  Note: There are other operators that only do longer tours (mostly to the Grand Canyon), but I think the below are it for shorter \\'Las Vegas from the air\\' tours. * Sundance - $200/35 minute tour, includes roundtrip transportation between hotel and hanger. They suggest reservations four or more days in advance. These can be cancelled up to 24 hours before flight time without penalty.  * Stars and Stripes Air Tours http://starsandstripesair.com/  currently offering a $99 for a 15 minute ride special (normally $120), includes roundtrip ground transport to and from hotel. Their website also mentions a 90 minute $600 \\'pilot training\\' that looks like a blast. They say same day reservations are usually OK. Confusingly, they also do business under the name Las Vegas Helicopter.  * Maverick http://www.maverickhelicopter.com/vegasnites.php $99 for 10 minutes, ground transport not included. Same day reservations usually OK.   What happens in Vegas is supposed to stay in Vegas, but I\\'m bring my Sundance memories with me - I want to treasure them for a long time.\\n\\n\\nProblem: What would be an example of an positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) review?\\n\\nAnswer: After months of seeing the girls in the office enjoying what always appeared to be fresh pasta, I ventured into La Famiglia last week to finally give it a try - and am kicking myself for not going 8 months ago when I started working in this area!!    The wait is a little long for lunch, so don\\'t go expecting something out of the microwave and in your hand in 5 minutes.  It is all made/baked to order and takes a little more time.  With lunch specials of pasta, side salad and a drink for $5.95, it is well worth the wait!    Last week I tried their Italian Hero sandwich, it was so good.  I had always been a fan of Cousins Subs and didn\\'t think anything would beat their Italian - until I had it here.  Today, I tried the stuffed shells.  Again, delicious.  Cooked to perfection and the flavors making my taste buds want more and more.  My only gripe would be that they don\\'t give you any garlic rolls with the lunch specials, and they are much needed for the sauce after your finished the pasta - no note to self, next time order a side of them!   I look forward to tasting each and every item on the menu in the next few weeks.\\n\\n\\nInput: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive.\\nGenerate a negative review for a place\\nOutput: Really wanted this to be a great place.Sure looks good inside & I have to say the service was great. However I found the food way over priced and the portions small (Yeah I know Tapas are small plates) but from $12-$14 give me some meat. Drinks were tasty & I enjoyed the white sangria over the red but again pricey. Nothing really blew my top which is sad and I don\\'t think I will be back I\\'m sorry to say. Lower your price or increase the portion size. I\\'m not cheap by any means.\\n\\n\\ninput: Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\noutput: This hotel is really a disappointment. Service doesn\\'t exist, you\\'re herded around the maze like cattle, the sheets were dirty (complete with stuck on un identifiable goobers). So many better places to stay on the Strip for the same cost. Try Caesar\\'s, Mandalay Bay, THE Hotel, MGM, Mirage. Just about any other casino hotel has been significantly better. The pools are disgusting! I wonder if the Dept of Health ever checks them. You can not see the bottom through the spilled drinks, urine (the smell is the giveaway) and the cloudiness of the water.

Before making a decision about dyeing your hair, talk to the hair stylist about potential damage.  If you're going platinum, there will be inevitably be some damage to your hair. A stylist may even refuse a platinum bleaching if your hair has been color treated previously as the damage could be more significant.  Talk to your stylist about how you want to lighten your hair. He or she can evaluate your hair's current condition and decide what color treatment will provide the least amount of damage. Damage caused by bleaching and dyeing is worse when it's close to your scalp and follicles. You should let your roots grow out at least a half an inch before getting a touch up. This can help minimize damage. Hair grows about a half inch per month on average, though this can vary by person and time of year. This means that it’s best to get a touch up every 4 to 6 weeks. Salon-dyed hair with professional products is probably the best way to go – it uses less harsh chemicals than at-home treatments. If you dye your hair at a salon, though, it may still need extra care afterwards. Talk to your stylist about how to give your hair extra TLC after dyeing.  Ask your stylist for recommendations for moisturizing conditioners and other at home treatment options. Hair dye can cause hair to be dryer than normal.  Consider a pre-wash primer before washing your hair. This can help block water, making a dye job last longer.  Consider coconut oil or protein-based conditioners. These can help fix damage done to hair via dyeing and bleaching.\\nSummary: Talk about potential hair damage. Leave your roots alone. Take extra care of your hair after dyeing.\\n\\nIn one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You should seek medical attention immediately after a whiplash injury. A complicating factor is that the pain and disability of whiplash can take a day or even a week to fully manifest, but see your family physician soon after any major trauma to your head and neck in order to rule out life-threatening injuries (fractures, dislocations, internal bleeding).  Your doctor will likely take an x-ray of your neck (cervical spine) to rule out obvious fractures or dislocations of the vertebrae or facet joints. If you're in severe pain and having difficulty holding your head up, then you may be given a foam neck support collar for short-term use. However, research has shown that wearing a stiff cervical collar for much more than a few days can cause neck muscles to atrophy (weaken) and prolong pain. Your family doctor is not a musculoskeletal specialist, so if your neck feels severely injured then you may need to see a specialist for a second opinion. A specialist such as an orthopedist may take more x-rays, an MRI or a CT scan of your neck / head to better understand and diagnose your whiplash injury.  In addition to bone injuries, MRI can detect soft tissue injuries, such as spinal cord damage, herniated disks or torn ligaments.  Before starting physical therapy your doctor(s) need to determine if your neck is structurally intact, physiologically stable and able to safely withstand stretching and exercising. Sharp or burning pain combined with grinding sounds with movements, shooting pains into your arms and severe dizziness are signs suggesting neck instability. Before you start to stretch and exercise your neck, you need to reduce the inflammation and pain. Your doctor may recommend non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen for short-term use, although if your pain is severe, you might get a prescription for something stronger — typically an opioid, such as oxycodone.  Alternatively, you can try over-the-counter analgesics such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) for your neck pain, but never take them concurrently with NSAIDs. Keep in mind that these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to use them for more than 2 weeks at a stretch. The application of ice is an effective treatment for essentially all acute musculoskeletal injuries, including neck pain. Cold therapy should be applied to the most tender part of your neck for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours in order to reduce the swelling and pain. Always wrap ice or frozen gel packs in a thin towel in order to prevent frostbite on your skin.\\nSummary:\"},\n",

We are addicted to Wi-Fi, the wireless networking technology that holds our youth in its wavy grip.\\n\\nHow bad is it? Seventy-five percent of American respondents to a survey sponsored by the Wi-Fi Alliance said that a week without Wi-Fi would leave grumpier than a week without coffee or tea. The poll, conducted by Wakefield Research, includes responses from more than 1,000 millennials (those between the ages 17 and 29) in the United States and 400 millennials in China, Japan and South Korea.\\n\\nTwo-thirds of respondents in the United States and four-fifths of those in China reported they spend more time on Wi-Fi devices than watching television. This distinction seems a bit blurry, however, since you can watch TV on your Wi-Fi connected smartphone as well as on a Wi-Fi-connected television.\\n\\nAnd many who watch traditional TV use a Wi-Fi device — smartphone, laptop or iPad — in tandem to dig up tidbits about the shows and movies as they watch.\\n\\nBut Wi-Fi enables more than entertainment: Many millennials said that Wi-Fi was critical to maintaining relationships with both friends and family. In fact, 44 percent of American respondents said it would be difficult to stay in touch with family members without Wi-Fi. Personally, I find this bit off. My mother is one of those goofy people (Hi Mom!) who never bought a PC, and my niece will only communicate through cellphone texting.\\n\\nSo what do these millennials want from Wi-Fi that they’re not getting now?\\n\\n“There is a desire for constant connectivity,” said Edgar Figueroa, chief executive officer of the Wi-Fi Alliance. “They want to connect while in a car, in a plane, while shopping.”\\n\\nWi-Fi is becoming increasingly available on airlines in the United States, with more than 1,200 planes expected to offer in-flight connectivity by year’s end. Cars remain a moving target, however, and connecting to Wi-Fi in a mall can be tricky because it’s difficult to determine which network to join.\\n\\nMr. Figueroa, who lives in Austin, Tex., says the city’s various shopping malls have taken a range of approaches to the shopping problem. Some malls offer a single Wi-Fi network throughout; in others, separate stores provide connections.\\n\\nThat’s not an optimal situation when you to need to quickly research pricing on that sweet-looking digital camera. Mr. Figueroa says the Wi-Fi Alliance is spearheading an initiative called Hotspot 2.0 that aims to help users find the best network, and then quickly and securely join it.\\n\\n“It should be transparent, like cellular roaming,” he said.\\nWhat was this article about?\\n++++++++++\\nIt\\'s about: A survey of young tech users found that Wi-Fi is more important than coffee and TV.\\n\\n\\nInput: Slam Trunk: Basketball-Playing Elephant Throws Down at the Zoo\\nBy Alex Magdaleno2014-08-28 15:13:50 -0400\\n\\nChuck, an Asian elephant from the African Lion Safari zoo in Cambridge, Ontario, has all the makings of an NBA star, evidenced by his dunking skills in a video uploaded Monday.\\n\\nHis promising basketball skills aside, Chuck has quite the pedigree. He was born on July 15, 2008, in captivity at the African Lion Safari, and according to zoo officials at the time, Chuck was the \"first third-generation calf born in North America.\"\\n\\nHe was the twelfth elephant born at the Ontario zoo since 1991 to mom, Mali from the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York, and dad, Rex from the African Lion Safari — both surely proud elephant parents.\\n\\nWe\\'re left with two questions. First, what was with the other elephant\\'s sloppy defensive game? Impressive as Chuck\\'s dunk is, he wasn\\'t covered. Second, it looks like Chuck also has a soccer goal — do we have a Bo-Jackson-style sports phenom on our hands?\\n\\nHave something to add to this story?

Garbage and broken glass littered streets lined with looted stores, while the charred remains of a few police and military vehicles sat outside the seat of government, the White House, which had been ransacked and burned, along with the chief prosecutor\\'s building. Across the boulevard was an abandoned armored personnel carrier, its tires slashed and an empty beer bottle sitting on the hood.\\n\\nAt least 75 people were killed and hundreds injured when security forces fired on protesters, who fought back and stormed key installations Wednesday.\\n\\nOpposition leaders said they had no immediate plans to close the U.S. air base at Manas International Airport, a major transit hub for personnel and equipment en route to Afghanistan. But they indicated that, at a minimum, Washington would be forced to negotiate fresh terms to maintain the military installation, less than a year after the Bakiyev government tripled the rent and extracted $150 million in other concessions.\\n\\nThe instability in Kyrgyzstan could complicate President Obama\\'s plan to send 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan as part of an even larger NATO buildup there. In March, 50,000 U.S. and allied forces heading to and from Afghanistan transited through the Manas air base, more than three times the monthly average last year.\\n\\nU.S. officials said they were forced to curtail flights at Manas on Thursday and confine all troops to the base.\\n\\nRoza Otunbayeva, a former foreign minister and ambassador to the United States, was named the leader of the interim government. She suggested that the new government would honor the U.S. lease for the base at Manas, which expires in July. But she made no promises beyond that, saying at a news conference, \"We still have some questions on it.\"\\n\\nSeveral opposition leaders had criticized Bakiyev for agreeing to host the base and the Obama administration for overlooking his government\\'s human rights abuses and suppression of democratic freedoms.\\n\\nOne leader of the interim coalition said the lease on the base might not last, citing Russia\\'s support for Bakiyev\\'s removal. Last year, Moscow thought it had persuaded Bakiyev to expel the U.S. military, but he changed his mind after Washington agreed to pay more.\\n\\n\"You\\'ve seen the level of Russia\\'s joy when they saw Bakiyev\\'s ouster,\" Omurbek Tekebayev, a former opposition leader now in charge of constitutional matters, told the Reuters news agency. \"So now there is a high probability that the duration of the U.S. air base\\'s presence in Kyrgyzstan will be shortened.\"\\n\\nRussia has operated an air base in the city of Kant -- about 40 miles from Manas -- since 2003.\\nWhat was this article about?\\n++++++++++\\nIt\\'s about:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Context and question: The allies\\' most advanced technologies were showcased by the anti-aircraft defence against the German V-1 cruise missiles (V stands for Vergeltungswaffe, \"retaliation weapon\"). The 419th and 601st Antiaircraft Gun Battalions of the US Army were first allocated to the Folkestone-Dover coast to defend London, and then moved to Belgium to become part of the \"Antwerp X\" project. With the liberation of Antwerp, the port city immediately became the highest priority target, and received the largest number of V-1 and V-2 missiles of any city. The smallest tactical unit of the operation was a gun battery consisting of four 90 mm guns firing shells equipped with a radio proximity fuse. Incoming targets were acquired and automatically tracked by SCR-584 radar, developed at the MIT Rad Lab. Output from the gun-laying radar was fed to the M-9 director, an electronic analog computer developed at Bell Laboratories to calculate the lead and elevation corrections for the guns. With the help of these three technologies, close to 90% of the V-1 missiles, on track to the defence zone around the port, were destroyed.\\nWhere did the US Army 419th and 601st relocate to as part of the Antwerp X project?\\nAnswer: Belgium\\nContext and question: Fears decreased when Stalin died in 1953 and Nikita Khruschev emerged as the Soviet Union\\'s new leader. Soon, life in Soviet Armenia began to see rapid improvement. The church, which suffered greatly under Stalin, was revived when Catholicos Vazgen I assumed the duties of his office in 1955. In 1967, a memorial to the victims of the Armenian Genocide was built at the Tsitsernakaberd hill above the Hrazdan gorge in Yerevan. This occurred after mass demonstrations took place on the tragic event\\'s fiftieth anniversary in 1965.\\nWhen did Vazgen acquire his position?\\nAnswer: 1955\\nContext and question: In Western Europe, some of the older Roman elite families died out while others became more involved with Church than secular affairs. Values attached to Latin scholarship and education mostly disappeared, and while literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than a sign of elite status. In the 4th century, Jerome (d. 420) dreamed that God rebuked him for spending more time reading Cicero than the Bible. By the 6th century, Gregory of Tours (d. 594) had a similar dream, but instead of being chastised for reading Cicero, he was chastised for learning shorthand. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction in the Church had become music and art rather than the book. Most intellectual efforts went towards imitating classical scholarship, but some original works were created, along with now-lost oral compositions. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris (d. 489), Cassiodorus (d. c. 585), and Boethius (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.\\nIn what year did Jerome die?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Some engineered hardwood manufacturers recommend installing underlayment between the flooring and a concrete subfloor. Underlayment prevents the flooring from moving and makes the floor quieter to walk on.You can use foam, wood, cement board, or another hard, thin layer for the underlayment. Plywood is a popular choice, as it can be nailed into place along the edges. Each manufacturer will have different spacing requirements, so make sure you check the directions. If your hardwood didn’t come with spacers, you can get some of your own from most home improvement stores. You should pour enough glue that it’s about the width of 2 or 3 boards. Then use the trowel to scrape the side of the bucket and prevent drips. You should hold the trowel at a 45-degree angle to the floor. Make sure the teeth of the trowel are touching the concrete, and spread the glue. You should only spread the glue far enough to work with 2 or 3 rows of flooring. Otherwise it will dry too quickly. You can use less glue than this to start if you’re nervous about timing. Spread enough for two rows until you get the hang of it and can work more quickly. They should be flush against the spacers, with the tongue facing out into the room. As you lay each new board down, make sure its edge is flush against the edge of the piece before it. This secures each row and makes sure there’s no space between them. As you set each new board, use a tapping block and mallet to secure it in place. The edges of the new boards should be staggered about 6 inches (15\\xa0cm) from each end. If you’re gluing the boards down, use a tapping block that lays on top of the board and has a curved edge the hangs down over the edge of the flooring. Otherwise your block will get stuck in the glue. Once you’ve finished gluing down your flooring, let it dry for 24 hours. If you haven’t finished the flooring but need to stop for a while, give it 24 hours before you step on it again. Once your flooring is in, remove the spacers and slide the trim pieces between the flooring and the wall. If necessary, use a flat bar to pull the trim taught against the first row of flooring.\\n\\nSummary: Add underlayment if recommended by the manufacturer. Lay out your spacers against the wall. Pour glue onto the concrete. Use the trowel to spread the glue. Lay the first row of boards. Fit the groove of the second row over the tongue of the first. Let the flooring dry for 24 hours. Install the trim.\\n\\n\\nImagine that a 120 pound woman consumed four 1.5 ounce drinks of an 80 proof liqueur over a five-hour period. Four 1.5 ounce drinks of an 80 proof liqueur is equivalent to four standard drinks in the United States. Multiply the number of standard drinks in this example (4) by 14 (the number of grams of alcohol in a standard drink in the United States) to find the alcohol dose, 56 grams of alcohol. 120 pounds is equivalent to 54480 grams (120 pounds x 454 grams per pound). Multiplying this by the gender constant (in this example, 0.55) = 29964 ). In this example, this equals approximately 0.0018689093579 (56 / 29964). For a less exact calculation, you can round this number to 0.00186. In this example, this gives the number 0.186 (0.00186 x 100). This number reflects the approximate BAC as a percentage, before accounting for elapsed time. In this example, you should first multiply the number of elapsed time in hours (5) by 0.015 = 0.075. Then, subtract this number from the approximate BAC as a percentage: 0.186 – 0.075 = 0.111. This means that the approximate BAC in this example at the end of the five hour period is 0.111.\\n\\nSummary: Understand the example. Count the number of drinks. Find the alcohol dose. Multiply the body weight in grams and multiply it by the gender constant. Divide the alcohol consumed in grams by (body weight in grams x gender constant. Multiply the raw number by 100. Account for elapsed time.\\n\\n\\nCarefully transfer your chocolate molds or baking sheet to the freezer and leave the bars to set for at least 15 minutes. You can store the chocolate in its molds, or remove them and keep your bars in a plastic bag in the freezer for around 1 month.\\n\\nSummary: Freeze the chocolate for 15 minutes or until hardened.\\n\\n\\nCheck online or in your local phone book to find a reliable locksmith. Call them to make sure that they offer safe-opening services and find out what the fees are.  The most common reason to need a locksmith is because you have forgotten or lost the combination to your safe. Occasionally safes can also jam or become damaged, in which case you will require the services of a locksmith to get them open and repair them.  Ask the locksmith if you will need to provide documentation to prove that you are the owner of the safe before they will open it. Schedule a house call, or take your safe in to the locksmith if it is small enough to transport yourself. Make sure you have enough time for the scheduled appointment, some safes will take longer to open depending on the complexity of the lock. Many locksmiths offer 24-hour services, in case you need something out of your safe urgently. Have the locksmith reset the combination on your safe. Store the new combo in a file cabinet or digitally where you can easily find it next time you need it. If you called a locksmith because your safe jammed or broke, make sure they perform any necessary repairs and that it is functioning before they leave.\\n\\n'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Q:\\nWhite House Sees Slow Growth in \\'08, But Not a Recession\\nThe economy may grow slowly the first half of this year, the Bush administration said yesterday, but it is not in recession.\\n\\nThe economic stimulus bill that President Bush plans to sign this week, combined with interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, will result in stronger growth in the second half of the year, according to the annual Economic Report of the President.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t think that we are in a recession right now, and we are not forecasting a recession,\" said Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the president\\'s Council of Economic Advisers, in a briefing with reporters. \"We are forecasting slower growth.\"\\n\\nMany leading private-sector forecasters do think the nation is, or soon will be, in a recession, including economists at Wall Street firms Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. The Bush administration\\'s sunnier expectations are consistent with those of private economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, who forecast an annualized 0.5 percent growth in the first three months of 2008 but a solid 2.7 percent growth rate in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nThe administration and Democrats in Congress were able to find common ground on a bill to stimulate the slumping economy, which Bush plans to sign tomorrow. But Bush has signaled reluctance to take further action of the sort being discussed on Capitol Hill, such as extending unemployment insurance benefits or creating a government entity to buy up subprime mortgage securities.\\n\\nDemocrats say Bush is ignoring evidence of a slowing economy. \"Despite agreeing to a much-needed economic stimulus package, the president still seems to be looking at our economy with rose-colored glasses,\" said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. \"The administration needs to recalibrate its overly optimistic economic assumptions in order to seriously address the declining fortunes of the middle-class families.\"\\n\\nLazear said yesterday that when the government has extended unemployment insurance in the past, the jobless rate has been 5.7 percent or more. It was 4.9 percent in January.\\n\\n\"It would be unprecedented to extend unemployment benefits at a time the unemployment rate is 4.9 percent,\" he said. He said that the stimulus bill passed last week will create a half-million more jobs than would have been created otherwise.\\n\\nIn a discussion of the problems in financial markets, which now appear to be bleeding into the broader economy, the president\\'s report argues that imbalances in such markets need to be allowed to work themselves out, suggesting that there will be no major government intervention in the troubled markets for complicated forms of debt.\\n\\nAside from narrow, targeted government actions, \"the best course of action is often to simply allow markets to adjust,\" the report said. \"Markets naturally self-correct, rewarding good strategies and punishing bad ones . . . any government actions mitigating the outcomes of risky behavior may create perverse incentives for reckless decisions by borrowers and investors who may come to rely on government interventions.\"\\n\\nThe Bush administration projected in November that the economy would grow 2.7 percent in 2008 and that the unemployment rate would edge up to 4.9 percent. Since then, economic news has pointed to much slower growth; joblessness was 5 percent in December before falling to 4.9 in January.\\n\\nAlthough he did not issue specific projections, Lazear appeared to back away from the November forecast yesterday, noting that private economists have become less optimistic since then.\\n\\nThe 354-page report emphasized gains that the United States is experiencing from rising exports, reflecting a dollar that has fallen in recent years. It acknowledged, however, that the strain in credit markets \"raises the possibility that spending by businesses and consumers could be restrained in the future.\"\\nWhat was this article about?\\nA:\\nThe economy may grow slowly the first half of this year, the Bush administration said yesterday, but it is not in recession.\\n\\n\\nPope Francis urges world leaders to protect environment, expatriates\\nPope Francis spoke to world leaders Friday morning, marking his second day in New York City in an international trip that first took the pontiff to Cuba, then Washington D.C. before heading to the Big Apple.\\n\\nThe pope, speaking to world leaders gathered for a U.N. General Assembly summit, championed the causes of protecting the environment, helping less affluent nations, aiding vulnerable people and avoiding war.\\n\\nFrancis expressed gratitude for the men and women of the United Nations who have worked to bring peace around the world.\\n\\n“I pay homage to all those men and women whose loyalty and self-sacrifice have benefitted humanity as a whole in these past 70 years,” the pope said. “In particular, I would recall today those who gave their lives for peace and reconciliation among people…the many United Nations officials at every level who have been killed in the course of humanitarian missions, and missions of peace and reconciliation.”\\n\\nThe pope warned about the proliferation of nuclear arms.\\n\\n“An ethics and a law based on the threat of mutual destruction – and possibly the destruction of all mankind – are self-contradictory and an affront to the entire framework of the United Nations, which would end up as ‘nations united by fear and distrust.’”\\n\\nThe pope has made environmental issues his central theme during his trip to the U.S. He is also expected to take up immigration during a rally in Philadelphia on Saturday.\\n\\nThe pontiff raised the plight of people fleeing their lands, specifically mentioning the refugees from Syria, among a few other nations.\\n\\nHe said that people must never be seen as mere statistics.\\n\\n“There are individual persons, our brothers and sisters, men and women, young and old, boys and girls who weep, suffer and die.”\\n\\nFrancis\\' agenda on Friday reflects both his global stature and his of-the-people approach, taking him from the solemnity of ground zero to the struggles of East Harlem.\\n\\nHis visit was scheduled to include events as large as a processional drive through Central Park, as personal as meetings with schoolchildren and immigrants, and as inspiring for the faithful as Mass for thousands at Madison Square Garden.\\n\\nFrancis was greeted on his arrival at the U.N. by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a key supporter of Francis\\' agenda. Francis thanked Ban and the U.N. staff for their service.\\n\\nWhile his visit marks the fifth time a pope has been to the United Nations, the Vatican flag was raised for the first time just before his arrival.

       "    'content': '– Iconic funnywoman Phyllis Diller has died in her Los Angeles home at the age of 95, reports TMZ. The trailblazing comedienne who rose to fame alongside Bob Hope had been in hospice care following a recent fall in which she injured her wrist and hip. “Phyllis Diller passed away peacefully in her sleep at 9:30am PT,\" her manager tells CNN. \"Her son, Perry, found her with a smile on her face.” “She was a true pioneer,” Diller’s agent tells Entertainment Weekly. “She was the first lady of stand up comedy. She paved the way for everybody.\" Diller mastered the art of self-deprecation, poking fun at her looks (“I love to go to the doctor. Where else would a man look at me and say, ‘Take off your clothes\\'?”) or her housekeeping prowess (\"The only thing domestic about me is that I was born in this country\"). But for a generation of female comics, she was it: “To a lot of us she was better than Bob Hope,” says Roseanne Barr.\\nLet\\'s expand this into a news article: Comedian, actress, artist, and author Phyllis Diller died Monday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 95. \\n  \\n “She was a true pioneer,” Diller’s longtime agent Fred Wostbrock told EW. “She was the first lady of stand up comedy. She paved the way for everybody. And she conquered television, movies, Broadway, record albums, nightclubs, books, and radio. She did it all. A true pioneer.” \\n  \\n The housewife-turned-advertising copywriter and mother of six got her big showbiz break in 1955 at the age of 37 when the owner of San Francisco’s now-defunct Purple Onion nightclub gave her a substitute stand-up spot one night. “When I went on, the room went totally quiet and I knew that I had this magnetic thing that you had to be born with,” Diller told EW in 2005. “You can’t buy it or even learn it.” Diller’s shtick — often revolving around her pathetic fictional husband “Fang” and her less-than-gorgeous looks (“I love to go to the doctor. Where else would a man look at me and say, ‘Take off your clothes?’”) — quickly made her famous. She became a legend to generations of female comics (“To a lot of us she was better than Bob Hope,” Roseanne Barr told EW). \\n  \\n In the 1960s and ’70s, Diller became a frequent guest on The Tonight Show, The Flip Wilson Show, and Laugh-In, though TV series meant to showcase the comic (The Phyllis Diller Show, The Beautiful Phyllis Diller Show) never took off. She continued to get work as she got older, appearing in movies like A Bug’s Life as well as TV shows such as Family Guy, 7th Heaven, and The Drew Carey Show. In 2005, the same year she published her autobiography (Like a Lampshade in a Whorehouse), she appeared along with Sarah Silverman and Bob Saget in the humor documentary The Aristocrats, proving that even 88-year-olds can tell dirty jokes — in her case, in a typically zany wig and punctuated by her trademark cackle of a laugh. \\n  \\n Read more: \\n  \\n Phyllis Diller gets the last laugh \\n  \\n Scott McKenzie, singer of ‘San Francisco,’ dies \\n  \\n ‘Top Gun’ director Tony Scott dies at age 68 in apparent suicide \\n  \\n Ron Palillo of ‘Welcome Back, Kotter’ dies of heart attack ||||| Comedian Phyllis Diller, known for her self-deprecating humor, died \"peacefully in her sleep\" at her Los Angeles home Monday morning, her manager told CNN. Diller was 95. \\n  \\n \"Her son, Perry, found her with a smile on her face,\" Milt Suchin said. \\n  \\n Diller , who paved the way for female comedians, began her legendary stand-up comedy career at the age of 37. \\n  \\n \"We lost a comedy legend today,\" comedian Ellen DeGeneres tweeted. \"Phyllis Diller was the queen of the one-liners. She was a pioneer.\" \\n  \\n Diller\\'s career as a stand-up comic skyrocketed in the 1960s, partly because of her many appearances with Bob Hope on his television specials and USO tours. Diller remained good friends with Hope until his death. \\n  \\n iReport: Phyllis Diller original paintings \\n  \\n She became a pop culture icon for her disparaging jokes about her looks, her cooking and her husband \"Fang.\" \\n  \\n \"She was a true pioneer,\" said talent agent Fred Wostbrock. \"She was the first lady of stand-up comedy. She paved the way for everybody. She paved the way for Joan Rivers, Chelsea Handler, Roseanne Barr, Ellen Degeneres, and all the women stand-up comics. She was the first and the best.\" \\n  \\n Comedian Whoopi Goldberg tweeted that she was said the world lost a funny, classy and smart woman like Diller. \\n  \\n \"A true original has died,\" Goldberg tweeted, adding that there was nobody who looked or sounded like her. \\n  \\n Diller\\'s first appearance on TV was as a contestant on Groucho Marx\\'s show \"You Bet Your Life.\" \\n  \\n Diller was also known her for hilarious roasts of major personalities.

A sampling of the reactions: \"Why has the Bieb launched a campaign to traumatize everyone who\\'s old enough to remember the \\'90s?\" moans Margaret Hartmann on Jezebel. His Boyz II Men video was bad enough, but \"now he\\'s released a Macy\\'s commercial disguised as a Mariah Carey duet—though we used that term loosely because it sounds like Bieber is just wailing over the old recording of the song.\" \"It is not so much that Justin Bieber\\'s remix is bad—It\\'s not! It can\\'t be! This song is bad-proof!\" writes a forgiving Amanda Dobbins in New York. \"It\\'s just that it feels particularly unnecessary, given the wonder that is the original. And when Justin is singing his verse, it\\'s hard not to wish Mariah Elf were singing instead.\" On Gawker, Matt Cherette calls the video \"life-ruining,\" and wonders what in the world was up with the fact that Carey spent most of it \"dressed in a slutty Santa costume, dancing seductively in front of a green screen that was made to look like an artificial stone wall panel.\" Not surprisingly, the Huffington Post adds, some parents are less-than-pleased with the flirting between 17-year-old Bieber and 41-year-old Carey in the vid.\\n'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Let\\'s expand this into a news article: Justin Bieber can\\'t go a full week without getting himself into another controversy -- and this time, it has nothing to do with Mariah Yeater. There\\'s a new Mariah making headlines with the Biebs, and her name is Mariah Carey. \\n  \\n In the duo\\'s new music video for \"All I Want For Christmas\" -- a newer version of Carey\\'s 1994 megahit, off Bieber\\'s newly-released \"Under the Mistletoe\" album -- Carey shows off her post-pregnancy body in a sexy Santa Claus outfit, while Bieber and his friends shop for holiday gifts, like high-top kicks and Nintendo DS\\'. Then Bieber becomes some sort of Willy Wonka/Santa hybrid as people rush into the store with their golden tickets, only to be showered with gifts from the teen superstar. \\n  \\n Of course, it gets weirder from there. Throughout the video, Carey, 41, and Bieber, 17, share more than a few flirty looks, and some parents are not so pleased -- just look at these comments -- with Bieber getting cozy with the pop icon. We\\'re sure it won\\'t stop Beliebers from constantly playing it in their parents\\' cars from now until Christmas day. \\n  \\n Take a look at Bieber\\'s latest controversy below. \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  ||||| Tonight, NBC aired its annual Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting special. It was boring! Well, except for the part where Justin Bieber debuted the music video for his duet with Mariah Carey of \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (Superfestive!).\" Because what the hell? \\n  \\n OK, so first of all, can we please discuss the fact that Carey spent the majority of the video dressed in a slutty Santa costume, dancing seductively in front of a green screen that was made to look like an artificial stone wall panel? Because what was that? Oh, and what was with Bieber spending its entirety standing atop some tacky riser in the middle of an abandoned Macy\\'s, singing emphatically to... nobody? \\n  \\n What does it all mean? If your guess was, \"The 17-year-old seemingly still prepubescent boy, singing all emphatically atop his riser, was doing so to woo the object of his affection, that being the 41-year-old slutty Santa green screen dancing lady, and vice versa,\" then congratulations/you\\'re just as weird as the people who thought up the concept for this music video. ||||| This is how many of you will choose to interpret the \"Superfestive!\" remake of \"All I Want for Christmas If You,\" and, frankly, Vulture hears you. It is not so much that Justin Bieber\\'s remix is bad — It\\'s not! It can\\'t be! This song is bad-proof! — it\\'s just that it feels particularly unnecessary, given the wonder that is the original. And when Justin is singing his verse, it\\'s hard not to wish Mariah Elf were singing instead. Eventually, she chimes in again, and there\\'s a nice bit toward the end with the two of them and a sleigh and a holiday puppy (even Bieber\\'s harmonizing is kind of fun in that section, especially the \"Shout\" riff). There\\'s also plenty of \"Mariah sexily dancing against a fake wall,\" even though she has to split screen time with the Biebz. One final question: Is Bieber wearing a plaid \"shircket\" (shirt + jacket)? Discuss. ||||| We\\'ve never really had a problem with Justin Bieber. We may not get it, but the kiddies have their music and we have ours. So why has the Bieb launched a campaign to traumatize everyone who\\'s old enough to remember the \\'90s? First he convinced Boyz II Men to make a ridiculous video with him, and now he\\'s released a Macy\\'s commercial disguised as a Mariah Carey duet — though we used that term loosely because it sounds like Bieber is just wailing over the old recording of the song. Hope you enjoyed listening to the original for the last 17 years, because this version is all you\\'ll be hearing while doing your holiday shopping. \\n  \\n Earlier: Here\\'s That Justin Bieber/Boyz II Men Holiday Tune You Didn\\'t Ask For |||||'}]},\n",

       "    'content': 'INPUT ARTICLE: Article: Cheer yourself up by buying souvenirs and gifts for the people you miss. Looking for the perfect gift will help occupy your free time and, when you find something that reminds you of them, you can anticipate seeing them again.  Try to buy thoughtful gifts that show your loved ones you were thinking of them while you were gone. Spending time to find a thoughtful present is a great way to alleviate homesickness. But remember to stay within your budget. Your loved ones wouldn’t want you overspending on your trip because you bought too many expensive gifts. If you have a good connection and the time difference isn’t too severe, take your friends and family on virtual tours of the place you are visiting via apps like Skype or FaceTime. You can also send regular texts and emails with pictures so that your loved ones can “follow” you on your trip. Do some of the things you like to do at home while you are traveling in a new location. Find a good bookstore to browse if you miss your favorite one, or find a local eatery that makes a great burger that resembles burgers you get at home. Experiencing new things is one of the most exciting parts of traveling. But if you mix in a few reminders of home as well, this can help you enjoy the experience more overall.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Buy gifts for loved ones. Use technology to virtually bring your loved ones along. Find the comforts of home.\\n\\n\\nINPUT ARTICLE: Article: Then put the greenhouse at the desired place in the garden.  Depth is about 15 cm (6 inch). The \"waves\" in the sheets form air openings.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Lift the greenhouse at the 2 loops on top of the bows. Push 4 pens in the 4 small loops to fix the greenhouse. At each end push one small plate of corrugated sheet or 2 overlapping plates in the earth against the edge of the greenhouse tunnel.\\n\\n\\nINPUT ARTICLE: Article: Don\\'t just say something, do something. It sometimes bothers your spouse when you consistently say you\\'ll do something, but never get around to doing it. When your words don\\'t have any initiative behind them, they start losing some of their oomph and your spouse may start trusting you less. Don\\'t make excuses. Excuses may be real for you, but they sound like excuses to your spouse. Don\\'t bring your past \"mistakes\" into your new relationship, this is also seen as an excuse, no matter what the situation, abuse, hurt, financial suffering, don\\'t bring it up. Anything can  be over come and worked through with time talk to your partner about this, than leave it in the past, don\\'t keep using it as a  crutch hold in your future. Man or woman up, admit when you make a mistake, and try to make it better next time. Your spouse will notice. Love is not a competition: It\\'s not about getting your due or being \"even\" with your spouse. Trust that your partner realizes how lucky s/he is to have you.  Don\\'t always ask for validation. Validation is important, but learn to get by without it, even if you desperately want it. You may have just gotten your wife an amazing gift, and for whatever reason, she\\'s not especially grateful; trust that she appreciates your effort and the present, and don\\'t dwell on the lack of validation. Trust your partner to be by him/herself. Unless there\\'s a history of infidelity, trust your partner to make responsible, loving decisions in your absence. If they\\'re out for beers with friends, or at a bachelorette party, trust them. They\\'ll be surprisingly likely to honor your trust if you actually extend it. Love is an act of the will, not a warm feeling or a clever expression of experience. Although love is different for every person, and every person shows it differently, love often requires you to deny yourself and seek to meet your beloved\\'s needs.  Think about the last time your spouse made you smile. What did s/he do to make you feel like you were the luckiest person in the world? Is there anything that you can do that might make them feel the same way back to you? Go the extra mile for them. The modern world has made us busy; we\\'re constantly doing stuff, and we never seem to have enough time to do it. Can you go out of your way to help your spouse do something that they need to do, that they dislike doing, or merely something they\\'d appreciate? Get the oil changed in her car; press or iron his shirts before a big day at work or an interview; help in the kitchen so the two of you can enjoy the evening together. Buy a gift certificate and urge her to go shopping with her girlfriends; help do the lawn, clean the gutters, or prune the trees.\\n\\nSUMMARY: Remember that actions often speak louder than words.

       "    'content': 'Problem: Article: When it comes to non-emergency medical transport, you can get it paid for by Medicare and other insurances, but it has to be ordered by a doctor and be medically necessary. If a person you are caring for needs this kind of transport, first talk to the doctor. If the person doesn\\'t qualify for transport, you can still book transport for them if they can pay for it out of pocket. Most doctor\\'s offices will have a preferred transport service that they will call if you don\\'t have the preference. In fact, in some states, the doctor\\'s office must book the transport for you to be covered under Medicaid or Medicare. However, you can also choose a transport company yourself if you are paying for the service out-of-pocket. Look for non-emergency medical transport in the phone book or online.  If you\\'re unsure which one to choose, ask for a recommendation at the doctor\\'s office. Another way to help you narrow choices is to ask the transport company if they are authorized for Medicare or Medicaid. Companies that are contracted by the government for these services must meet certain standards. You can also ask about their safety record. If they\\'re not willing to discuss it with you or send you information, they are likely not very safe. Cost is of course a factor when choosing a medical transport company. For instance, even if your transport is covered by Medicare, you\\'ll likely need to pay the 20% co-pay. Therefore, it\\'s a good idea to call several places to figure out which will be the cheapest for you overall. Some companies may require prepayment, particularly if you\\'re not covered by insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid. Once you have a medical appointment scheduled for the person, generally the doctor\\'s office will schedule the transport for the person if they need it and if they qualify for it. Be sure to let the office know that the person needs transportation to the appointment. Obviously, emergency transportation services are reserved for when it\\'s an emergency. If the person needs immediate care, due to a fall or other serious injury or illness, then calling an ambulance is appropriate. Generally, this service is covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and most insurances.\\nSummary: Talk to the doctor. Choose a medical transport company. Compare costs. Make an appointment. Use 911 for an emergency.\\n\\nINPUT ARTICLE: Article: Tap the App Store app icon, which resembles a white \"A\" on a light-blue background. This option is in the lower-right corner of the screen.

Some articles will be more complicated than others. Read fluffier material quickly, and slow your pace when you reach something more complicated.  Some articles can be skimmed or read very quickly. A local interest story about a new restaurant, for example, is probably not very complex. You can breeze through this article quickly and still learn most of the necessary information. An article that\\'s covering, say, a recent political debate is probably more complex. You will have to slow your pace to read articles of this nature. Even though you are reading slowly here, you will still get through the paper faster having skimmed less complicated articles. News can be a bit redundant. Sometimes, information will appear in more than one section. For example, an op-ed about a current event may include facts you already read in an article. Another article may contain basic information about ongoing current events you already know.  If you start reading something that sounds familiar, skim or skip over the paragraph. If an entire article seems like information you already know, it\\'s okay to skip it. If you read news online or watch the news, information in a newspaper may be repetitive. Many people have a tendency to talk to themselves when reading. You may whisper the words out loud as you read them in your head. This habit can actually greatly slow down your reading pace.  Pay attention to your mouth when you read. Try to be aware of mouthing the words out loud. If you catch yourself whispering or talking, stop. You will finish the paper quicker if you\\'re not talking out loud. You may also find you\\'re talking to yourself silently in your head while you read. You may be repeating the words in your head a second time or adding commentary. Try to silence your internal monologue when you\\'re reading. Contrary to what many believe, reading a phrase over and over again does not improve comprehension. It can also slow down your reading speed. If you\\'re reading a complex article, it\\'s more effective to slow down and read carefully. This will get the job done quicker and help you better retain the information.\\nSummary: Vary your reading speed. Skim or skip over information you already know. Do not talk to yourself when you read. Avoid re-reading phrases.\\n\\nIf you have had infestation problems in the past, make sure the equipment is far away from the source and clear of waste that may attract other insects. This can help to drain wastes away from the area and avoid contamination. Set a schedule to dump the debris whether or not the removal container is full. Keep all areas that are not in use free of dishes, waste and personal belongings. The walls, floors, ceiling and appliances should be free of clutter for easy cleaning.\\n++++++++++\\nOne-sentence summary -- Move equipment away from locations that attract insects or rodents.

The whole conversation took up very little more time than it will take to read it; but I thought it worth recording, as characteristic of the people now suffering in Lancashire from no fault of their own.  I know the people well.  The greatest number of them would starve themselves to that degree that they would not be of much more physical use in this world, before they would condescend to beg.  But starving to death is hard work.  What will winter bring to them when severe weather begins to tell upon constitutions lowered in tone by a starvation diet--a diet so different to what they have been used to when in work?  What will the 1s.  6d.  a-head weekly do for them in that hard time?  If something more than this is not done for them, when more food, clothing, and fire are necessary to everybody, calamities may arise which will cost England a hundred times more than a sufficient relief--a relief worthy of those who are suffering, and of the nation they belong to--would have cost.

Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip. \\n\\nQuestion: \"What kind of deposits build up in caves as water continues to drip?\"\\n\\nResponse: \"Stalagmites\"\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n\\nA: yes\\n\\n\\nAce , a wannabe rock star , is on his way to a concert of the band Guitar Wolf when space aliens invade the Earth .

Harper\\'s spokespeople have handled the exposure with a joke via twitter saying: \"We\\'re not impressed. Everyone knows the PM is a cat person.\"While I think the comparison is valuable, that\\'s only because it provides such a contrast, as it underlines the difference between a fully Western-orientated democracy and a democracy under construction. While on the one hand the vast majority of Western-minded (and therefore more likely white) opinion is that the artist\\'s right to freedom of expression trumps everything else, the truth is lots of South Africans are offended by it on the basis of a simple difference in culture - one in which many blacks feel that Zuma should be immune to such satirical depiction.That regardless of what anyone thinks of his polygamy, policies, past allegations of corruption and rape - when it comes to what is inside his pant, it\\'s none of our business.\\nWhat was this article about?\\n++++++++++\\nIt\\'s about: A painting of South African President Jacob Zuma exposing his genitals has been all over the news here lately.It has kicked up a furore over the artist\\'s right to freedom of expression which in this case conflicts with many Africans\\' belief that as president, Zuma deserves the respect due people in powerful positions.The art work was smeared with red and black paint by two people on Tuesday after days of increasingly angry rhetoric from Zuma\\'s African National Congress, its political allies and Zuma\\'s own family.The Goodman Gallery\\'s been \"astonished\" by the response but has refused to take it down.\\n\\n\\nInput: Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Takes $74 Million at Weekend Box Office\\nAmericans can’t get enough of those damn dirty apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes took the number-one spot at box offices this weekend, debuting with a $74 million domestic gross.\\n\\nThe sequel’s performance surpasses both expectations for a $60 million opening and the opening-weekend gross of 2011′s Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which took home $54.8 million, Variety reports.\\n\\n“It’s one of those rare times when critics and audiences agree and the confluence created a perfect storm for a phenomenal opening,” Chris Aronson, president of domestic distribution at 20th Century Fox, told Variety.\\n\\nRichard Linklater’s Boyhood, which was shot over the course of 12 years and earned rave reviews, earned $359,000 from a limited release with only a handful of screening locations across New York and Los Angeles. That’s not a lot compared to the Apes‘ multi-millions, but its per-screen average of $71,800 is the second-highest of the year after The Grand Budapest Hotel and the highest in Linklater’s career. The movie will expand to more theaters this weekend.\\n\\n“We want to keep it slow and not go out on 800 screens in week two or three,” Jonathan Sehring, president of IFC Films, said. “The awareness is high, the media attention has been tremendous, and the word of mouth in the Twitter-sphere and social media universe is outstanding, so we’re going to continue to build on this.”\\n\\nTransformers: Age of Extinction meanwhile took second place, crossing the $200 million mark domestically and continuing to perform well overseas, while Tammy, starring Melissa McCarthy, fell to third place.

Located in a strip mall on the west side, there's lots of parking here. I think I got checked in by a new employee, because another woman carrying a baby was guiding her, but she left before the party started. I was given socks since I was wearing sandals, and didn't know about the rule.  Front area: numerous shoe storage cubes (lots of them!), a couple benches, the registration desk, and the dutch door.  Facilities: Main playing room (lots of seating here, as well as, small round tables for dining as well), rectangle-shaped dining room with two long tables and chairs (right side is great for setting up the food and drinks, while the bathroom is on the left side), bathrooms (there are 2); the one in the corner has a cushioned baby changing station complete with diaper genie.  So many playing possibilities here, but best for kids, aged 10 and under. Vinnie attended his first non-family birthday party here a month ago, today. It was a birthday party for a friend's son who turned one- year old, over the weekend. And, as usual, when we were leaving this fun place, he cried, but he was tired, too. What did he like the best? The slide!!! Once he knew how to reach the slide (you have to climb up over the rugged ramp; I helped him down many times), it was over, he kept going up, then down, and repeat! He also liked the roller-coaster (there are two)---but very important, this area needs adult supervision. No brakes, so I was kinda stopping him a few times.  I'm going to describe it starting from the exterior of the main play room, then work my way in. In one corner, there is a soft building blocks play area. Next to that is the two roller coasters. Kitty corner from the soft blocks, is the slide/jungle gym area, with punching bags (?- don't really think they are meant for punching, thiugh), and a little swing. There is more to this area, more areas up on the slide level, like where Vinnie got stuck and an adult had to help him out (thanks to her). In the corner of that room, is the little section with play cars and nearby is the chalkboard. On the back side of that board, is the bathroom. Next to that wall, is the main dining room, which is spacious. There is a sofa along the wall. Next to the sofa, is the large dollhouse for little girls. In that corner is the stage with a little piano. Along the wall, is a display area fronting the handful of little round tables and chairs. In the next corner is the registration desk. Along the wall with the dutch doors is another sofa (next to the roller coasters).   In the middle are three or four tables, one with a lego theme, one with an animal or little people theme, and I can't remember the other one. Then, there is the pool of balls. A little roundabout train is also nearby. Another playhouse with a little slide (for bigger kids). Then, there are little cars that the kids can drive.  Like I said, there is a ton of stimulating areas for the little ones. I'm not gonna lie, it was a lot of fun for us adults, too (yes, some adults partook). I was curious to see how our little guy was gonna be with other little ones, but he was fine. All in all, having attending a birthday party here, the experience was lots of fun. It's a clean facility where all guests wear socks, but I thought that at times maybe the single employee was a little overwhelmed with this around-25 person party (towards the end of the two hours).   Hope my review was helpful for other parents scoping indoor playgrounds. This is #1180!\\n\\nProblem: Write a negative (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) yelp review.\\nA: Thank you for your response Danielle (Manager).  Thank you for pointing out Document 10.C about gas transaction....How great is it, if I knew that a non-refundable prepaid gas is on 10.C section of the contract.  Why did not I know that,  is it because I do not work for your company.  Is it your job to communicate to your customer what the charges are before signing the contract.  We have business meetings to go to.  You think  we have time to look for section 10.C.  All I can say is, you guys are tying to hide the hidden charges from your customer.  You guys are not being honest and straight up.  And also, you did not mention anything about the rude customer service on the phone.  CSR did not talk for 10 minutes, then she decided to give the phone to someone else without letting me know.  I had to explain myself all over again.  Do you think this is right Danielle (manager). I think all of these could of been avoided with the right customer service attitude.  We will never use your company again ever, my friends and family  will not be using your company. (THIS IS MY RESPONSE TO DANIELLE manager, READ REPLY BELOW)  This Car Rental is very DISAPPOINTING...... BAIT AND SWITCH..... I would like to give this place a Big 0 Star if I can.   Daily rate is about $15 and insurance $11 additional from priceline.  According to them, they do not honor the online price, and so the insurance will be additional $26 a day.  They added hour/mileage fee $44 (whatever that is), concession recovery fee $16, customer facility charge $$11.25, license fee $7.47 plus surcharges and taxes about $9.  All together our 3 day car rental is a total of $208.60 instead of $78 + tax.  Customer service was really rude over the phone.  She could not answer all of my questions, and so she did not talk for at least 10 minutes ( I thought she hung up) and then another person came on the phone to talk.  I was so frustrated and heated that I finally told them I would return the car.  I used the car for half a day and they charge me $100 because I prepaid gas $38 that was not refundable.  There's nothing in the contract that will say prepaid gas is not refundable if it is not use.  I rented a car from ENTERPRISE and they did not charge me the prepaid gas until I returned the car.  I just had to let them know that I will not be putting gas when I return it.  And ENTERPRISE allows you to do prepay without charging until you drop off the car to know how much gas you use.  UNBELIEVABLE... THIS PLACE IS THE WORST CAR RENTAL EVER.  DO NOT BE FOOLED WITH THEIR LOWEST PRICE BECAUSE BEHIND IT, WILL CHARGE MORE THAN TWICE OF WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE.  FROM $78 TO $208...THINK ABOUT IT......\\n\\nProblem: Write a negative (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) yelp review.\\nA:\"},\n",

Implementation will vary among airlines. The FAA expects many carriers to show that their planes allow passengers to safely use their devices in airplane mode, gate-to-gate, by the end of 2013. Devices must be held or put in the seat-back pocket during the actual takeoff and landing. Mobile phones must be in airplane mode or with mobile service disabled, with no signal bars displayed, and cannot be used for voice communications due to Federal Communications Commission regulations that prohibit any airborne calls using mobile phones.

Until the early 20th century, Literary Chinese was used in Vietnam for all official and scholarly writing. Around the 13th century the Nôm script was developed to record folk literature in the Vietnamese language. The script used Chinese characters to represent both borrowed Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary and native words with similar pronunciation or meaning. In addition thousands of new compound characters were created to write Vietnamese words. This process resulted in a highly complex system that was never mastered by more than 5% of the population. Both Literary Chinese and Nôm were replaced in the early 20th century by Vietnamese written with the Latin-based Vietnamese alphabet.\\nIs there an answer to this question: What were once in widespread use?\\n\\nAnswer: Chinese characters in Vietnam\\n\\nMastic asphalt is a type of asphalt which differs from dense graded asphalt (asphalt concrete) in that it has a higher asphalt/bitumen (binder) content, usually around 7–10% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% added asphalt/bitumen. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 °C (410 °F) and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 millimeters (0.79 inches) thick.\\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): How is asphalt used in the construction industry?\\nAh, so..\\n'},\n",

The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don\\'t have a clue... KIDS Bring \\'em! We\\'ll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we\\'ll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them. The more kids the better.

Since I moved to Phoenix a little over a month ago, I\\'ve been quite surprised by the number of car wash businesses around here. \"It never rains,\" I thought. \"Why so much need for car washing?\"  I have since realized that the dust makes me want to keep my car clean. Plus I\\'m just *in* my car a lot more now than I used to be when I was living in Boston. Getting it washed every two weeks or so feels normal out here.   I stopped by Prestige on a Saturday afternoon just to get a quick full-service wash on my way home. It was shocking how many times I had to say \"no\" to the attendants, all who offered to buff out a dent, shampoo my upholstery, and replace my entire windshield. I had to keep saying \"not this time, guys. Just the car wash.\"   The wash itself took a pretty long time (a good 15 minutes) and I was waiting in their dirty lobby area for a while with many others who were also waiting. They finally finished the car and while they did an OK job, it was nothing to write home about. Certainly not worth all the hassle.\\n\\nProblem: Write a positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) yelp review.\\nA:'},\n",

However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon?

It too has many Continents are much older than ocean basins. Some rocks on the continents are billions of years old. Ocean basins may only be millions of years old.

       "    'content': \"Choose one of your feet to start with and stand on the middle of the band with it. Position the band so it’s underneath your toes rather than in the center of your foot. Hold the ends of the resistance band with both hands so it has a small amount of resistance when your arms are straight.  It doesn’t matter which foot you start with since you’ll switch them later on. You can choose to curl both arms at the same time or only curl the arm that’s opposite of the leg you’re stepping forward with. Step forward with your other foot so it’s about 2–3 feet (61–91\\xa0cm) in front of the resistance band. Make sure your feet point forward so you can maintain your form. Keep your knees slightly bent and your back straight so you’re looking forward.  Stepping forward adds tension to the resistance band. If it feels too tight or difficult to pull, loosen your grip on the end or use a lower resistance. Don’t step too far forward where you’ll easily lose your balance since the resistance band could snap back toward you if you fall. Lower your body closer to the ground by bending your knees. Keep your back straight as you get closer to the ground to work out your legs and hips. When your knee in front forms a 90-degree angle, keep holding the position for 1-2 seconds. Don’t lift your feet off the ground while you’re lunging since the resistance could slip from underneath your foot. As you lower your body into the lunge position, bend your elbows to bring your hands closer to your shoulders. Keep your palms facing inward and your wrists straight to make stretching the resistance band slightly easier. Once your biceps are flexed, hold the lunge position and curl for about 1 second. Then lower your arms slowly to finish the curl.  You can use dumbbells if you want to add more weight to your routine. After 10-15 reps, switch which leg is in back so you get an even workout. Perform 10-15 reps for each leg for 2-3 sets.\\n++++++++++\\nOne-sentence summary -- Step on the center of the resistance band with one of your feet. Take a large step forward with your other foot. Bend your knees so they form 90-degree angles. Curl your arms toward your shoulder while maintaining the lunge position.\\n\\nQ: These are spices you definitely want more of you're looking to lose weight. They boost the body's metabolism thus ensuring that excess and redundant body fat gets burnt. The ability of capsaicin (an element of both) to burn the fat helps the body control its LDL (bad) cholesterol, too.  Capsaicin can also reduce the risks posed by ulcers by preparing the stomach cells to counter/resist any ulcer inducing bacteria. Coriander and black pepper has similar metabolism-boosting powers to chili. Cumin seeds are rich in thymol, an enzyme that boosts the digestive system in the body, has extraordinary fiber content and amazing laxative properties that can be a cure for constipation. There is also a component called cuminaldehyde present in cumin that can fight cancer and tumors.  Cumin is also great for maintaining memory and mental faculties owing to the presence of minerals such as vitamin B6, riboflavin, niacin and zea-xanthin. Consumption of cumin seeds is the most natural way to cure anemia as cumin seeds are rich in iron, too. They are also rich in potassium which is capable of promoting the flow of fluids in the body, helping to maintain blood pressure. Sage is a spice that is rich in memory enriching compounds called phenols. These phenols prevent or slow down the aging of the brain by breaking down the chemicals that normally lead to aging, preventing them from having any effect. Sage is also effective in controlling the initial symptoms of Alzheimer's by preventing destruction and exhaustion of the brain chemical acetylcholine which is involved in preserving the normal memory functions of the brain. Why? It's practically a wonder spice. It can boost the memory immediately! Include cinnamon in your diet before you go to study or take a test. It can help with weight loss, too.  How does it do it? Cinnamon does a great job of stabilizing the sugar and glucose levels in the body. When this spice is combined with a food rich in carbohydrates it ensures that the brain gets a steady dose of glucose instead of the glucose-bombardment carbs normally provide. Consuming about ½ teaspoon of cinnamon daily can reduce your cholesterol and triglyceride levels by up to 30%.  This is a near-to substitute for sugar and can be used in drinks, cereals, desserts and muffins. A small amount (as low as 1/10th teaspoon) of saffron daily is enough to keep you away from depression. This spice offers stiff resistance to depression by aiding the brain in the production of serotonin which is known to act as a natural mood booster. Rosemary should also be taken in moderation. Carnosic acid, a substance found in rosemary, has been found to protect the brain from any damage that might be caused by free radicals. This protection means the risk of Alzheimer's, stroke and other neurodegenerative diseases can be kept at bay. It is also highly effective in improving concentration and memory when used in aromatherapy.\\nA: Try more chili or cayenne pepper for an energy boost. Go for more cumin for your blood and brain. Use more sage for your memory. Garnish everything with cinnamon. Use more saffron and rosemary.\\n\\nArticle: Insert the hook through the first stitch or space to be worked over.  The hook should not be attached to any yarn yet. Note that the right side of the piece should face toward you but the yarn should be at the back. Grab the yarn with your hook. Pull both the yarn and hook through to the front of the piece. You should have one loop on your hook after completing this step. Insert the hook into the stitch or space directly next to the one you first worked in. Yarn over the hook from back to front. In one motion, pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the work while also pulling it through the loop previously on your hook.  If this motion is too difficult for you to master, you can pull the yarn-over through to the front of the work first before pulling it through the loop on your hook. You've essentially just completed one chain stitch over the surface of the original piece, thereby securing the yarn in place. Insert the hook back into the second worked stitch and follow the same procedure to create another chain stitch. Repeat this as many times as needed to build the size dot you desire.  For a moderately sized dot, create three to five of these stitches. Each of these chain stitches must be worked over the same stitch of your original piece. When you're satisfied with the dot size, insert the hook through the stitch or space directly next to the one your chain stitches were worked into. Yarn over the hook from back to front, then pull this yarn-over back through to the front of the work while simultaneously pulling it through the loop already on your hook.  As before, you can pull the yarn-over through to the front of the work before pulling it through the loop if doing so is easier for you. This final chain stitch closes the dot. Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to finish and secure the stitch. Pull the loose tail of yarn back through to the back of the work and weave it into the underside of the piece to hide it. This step also provides the dot with further security.\\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\\n\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Q: What\\'s an example of a movie review?\\nAn example of a movie review is here: Although I don\\'t usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this, I happened to catch the 1994 version of ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD (AitO) on cable one Saturday morning just as it was starting. Being an Adrien Brody fan, I was curious to see what Brody was like as a youth of 21 (20 when he filmed it, I suppose) in this early role as Danny Hemmerling, utility infielder for the California Angels (in the 1951 original, the hard-luck baseball team was the Pittsburgh Pirates. The name change is a nice touch, since it turns the title into wordplay). I decided to give the flick a chance, and it turned out to be a pretty painless, even amiable experience, with a decent balance of laughs, tears, sweetness, and baseball-based excitement. Also, my 7-year-old daughter liked the angel effects! :-) Directed by Mike Nesmith\\'s frequent collaborator William Dear, AitO is the story of Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a foster child who prays real hard after his ne\\'er-do-well dad (the convincingly sleazy Dermot Mulroney) sarcastically says they\\'ll be a family again once the last-place California Angels win the pennant. Soon Roger starts seeing real angels at the Angels\\' games, led by Christopher Lloyd, whose usual zany, eccentric irreverence keeps AitO from plummeting irretrievably into The Schmaltz Zone. Crusty manager George Knox (Danny Glover in world-weary, exasperated mode) is a hard sell, but once the team starts winning, he believes Roger\\'s angel sightings, and soon Knox has Roger and his cute li\\'l pal and fellow foster kid J.P. (the adorable Milton Davis Jr.) at every Angels game for good luck. Knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language, as much to appease the angels as for the kids\\' sake, resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along. Predictable obstacles ensue, such as obnoxious sportcaster Ranch Wilder (Jay O. Sanders) trying to make trouble for Knox because of the angel angle. Sure, it all works out fine for our heroes in the end, but they\\'re so darn amiable you don\\'t mind! :-) Baby-faced Brody has a couple of good lines (I especially like his exchange with Glover about the emotional impact of the National Anthem at a ballgame) as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat. Brody isn\\'t the only future star in AitO\\'s lineup: his teammates include Matthew McConaughey and Neal McDonough, and of course, young Gordon-Levitt went on to co-star in TV\\'s 3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN as well as such films as 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU. The always-amusing Taylor Negron and Oscar winners (but not for this film :-) Brenda Fricker and Ben Johnson lend able support. If you\\'re a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars, AitO \\'94 will do nicely.\\n\\n\\nProblem: Write a negative (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) movie review.\\n\\nAnswer: Richard Dix is a big, not very nice industrialist, who has nearly worked himself to death. If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him, can he find happiness for the last months of his life? Well, he\\'ll likely be better off if he disregards the VOICE OF THE WHISTLER.\\n\\nThis William Castle directed entry has some great moments (the introduction and the depiction of Richard Dix\\'s life through newsreel a la Citizen Kane), and some intriguing plotting in the final reels. Dix\\'s performance is generally pretty good. But, unfortunately, the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do. Also, the movie veers from a dark (and fascinating beginning) to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection (full of nice urban ethnic types who don\\'t mind that they aren\\'t rich) and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so.\\n\\nThis is a decent movie -- worth seeing -- but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role.\\n\\n\\nProblem: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive positive\\n=++++=\\nAnswer: Before viewing, please make sure you have seen Night of the Living Dead...

However, although this one frequently caught me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in that nearly EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from pot, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of pedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years-old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! Funny?! You\\'ve got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into the \"black hole of comedy\".

       "    'content': 'Q: This is the most common reason students have for missing school. If you genuinely do not feel well or believe yourself to be ill, tell your parents and ask to stay home.  Many schools will ask that you stay home if you have an illness or other condition that could be contagious. Staying home allows you to recover and also prevents the spread of disease throughout the school. Generally, you should stay home if you have a fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, sore throat, trouble swallowing, rash, unusual sores, unusual spots, earache, moderate to severe headache, moderate muscle ache, muscle pain, wheezing, difficulty breathing, red or burning eyes, or head lice.  You might also need to stay home if you are coughing, sneezing, or congested. Stay home until you are free of symptoms without medication for a period of 24 hours, if possible. For instance, if you have recently lost a family member, friend, or another individual who you were close to, your grief is a legitimate reason to stay home from school. Be honest with your parents about how deeply the loss has affected you.  If the tragedy affected you but did not affect your parents, you might worry that they will not understand your grief. Grief is a universal feeling, though, and most people can at least relate to it well enough to allow a grieving person time to work through it. Understand that, by necessity, your initial mourning period will need to have an end. Intense grief might last for a long time, and you might not be able to do anything about it on your own. If you do not feel capable of going to school after a few days to a week, though, you should consider talking to a counselor to help you work through your sorrow. If you are the victim of a bully or group of bullies at school, talk to your parents or legal guardians about it. Explain how difficult school life has become as a result of the bullying and ask to take a day or two off while the issues get sorted out.  Many students make the mistake of keeping quiet about their bullying. You might worry about seeming weak, being labeled a “tattletale,” or making things worse by talking about it. Nothing will ever get better if you do not take steps to put an end to the bullying, and during your adolescent years, getting help from parents, teachers, and other adults in your life is one of the most effective things you can do to get the bullying to stop.  Bullying can have long-term effects, such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia. Take care of your future self by speaking up about bullying when it happens. Tell your mom or dad that you’d like a special day with them, and ask them to call in sick from work. This plan might work especially well if you are graduating and moving away to college soon, or if it’s a light work day for you and your parent (e.g., you don’t have any tests or assignments due and your parent doesn’t have a pressing deadline). ” It’s important to talk to your parents about stress and anxiety. While adults occasionally forget just how stressful school life can be, the truth is that it really can be tough. If you are dealing with ordinary school-related stress, it might be more beneficial for you to push through. If stress, anxiety, and depression become more serious issues, though, let your parent or legal guardian know and ask for a day off. If you suspect that you might have a serious mental health issue, like depression or an anxiety disorder, ask your parents to schedule an appointment with your doctor, as well. Doing so can emphasize to your parents the severity of your stress, and if you do have an actual disorder, a trip to the doctor can help you get the disorder under control. In the event of a massive blizzard, major flooding, or other circumstances that make traveling to school dangerous, your school system might close for the day, regardless. If the conditions are hazardous and the school does not close, however, consider staying home. Usually, your parent or legal guardian can help determine if conditions are severe enough to justify staying home, so you might not need to do much persuading here. If your parents are staying home from work due to the weather, they will likely be more open to the idea of keeping you home from school, as well. A family vacation or visit from a relative who lives far away might give you a reason to be absent from school, but you should avoid missing school for reasons like this too often. Consider what you might miss if you go to school versus what you might miss if you stay home and work with your parents to decide of staying home is a valid option.  Note that many schools will not accept reasons like these as valid excuses. If this is the case with your school, you will need to let your parents know so that they can tell the school you will be absent without providing a reason. Typically, if you know that you will be home from school ahead of time, your parent or legal guardian should write a note for you to take in a day or two before your planned absence. This will give your teachers time to prepare work for you to take home over your absence.\\nA: Let your parents know if you are sick. Stay home after a tragedy. Be honest if bullying is a problem. Ask to play hooky. Get permission for a “mental health day. Stay home if weather or other environmental conditions require it. Take other special circumstances into consideration.\\n\\nQ: Don’t let your wedding planning add stress to your relationship. Take time to de-stress together. This can be as simple as walking the dogs together or going to the spa. Either way, your fiancé is only your fiancé for a short period, so enjoy them while it lasts. Allow time to indulge. With a full plate of wedding planning, work, and the rest of your life, it can be easy to let time get away from you. If you’re finding you’re too busy to fit fun into your schedule, schedule it in. Pick a day in advance and take time to do something fun together while forgetting about the wedding for the time being. A wedding speech is a way for you to sit back and relax while having a fun laugh, meaningful cry and hopefully memorable surprises. Don’t hesitate to ask for speeches from your guests. It’s a sure way to make the guest feel valuable. It doesn’t need to be limited to speeches, either. Before the big date, ask someone close to you to do a special dance, since a song or make a picture slideshow. Be cautious not to put pressure on the guests. While some guests may feel comfortable with public speaking, some may not. A forced speech is a failed speech and will surely end up with uncomfortable moments for you, your bride/groom and your guests. When the day is here, breathe and release. This is what you’ve been planning for months, so you’d better drink that expensive wine and eat that expensive food. Mingle with your guests and eat a second piece of cake. Don’t worry about any stress, as it will be over the next day.  Don’t sweat the small stuff. Maybe it rained in your pictures or the food was late. Try not to get worked up over things that were out of your control. This can put you in a bad mindset and you don’t want to be cranky the night of your wedding. Change those heels for more comfortable shoes. Having an intimate wedding means that you’ve got a small amount of guests to interact with. Get out there, talk to them and watch them enjoy your hard work.  Select a male and female host to deal with any social faux-pas. If you think you might have a creepy cousin or a wine-happy aunt, delegate an affable friend or family member to help deal with any awkwardness. Having picked someone in advance to de-escalate any conflicts means you can relax and enjoy yourself, rather than worrying about playing therapist to your guests.\\nA:'},\n",

Rehana Bibi was killed in her home in the village of Matan Kallaan, in Punjab province, Pakistan, after defying her uncle\\'s demands to lower the volume on her tape-recorder. \\'Two bullets were fired at the girl. One hit her in the head while the other on her face. She died on the spot,\\' a police official told local media. A Pakistani shopkeeper browses through music compact discs at his shop in Peshawar. Violence against women is rampant in Pakistan, with hundreds killed every year in the name of \\'honour\\'. Rehana\\'s father, Munsib Khan, told police that on Saturday he had left home early to go to work. His younger brother, Muhammad Gullistan, came to his house at 10am. It is believed Gullistan found Rehana listening to loud music and told her to turn it off. She refused and the pair began to fight. \\'The girl Rehana Bibi was alone at her home and was listening to music when her uncle Muhammad Gulistan... came to her house and asked to lower the volume,\\' Sadat Ali, an official on duty at Kallar Kahar police station, told AFP. \\'On her refusal, they quarrelled and Gulistan shot her dead,\\' said Mr Ali. Gullistan fled the village after the attack. A map shows the location of Matan Kalan, the village where a teenage girl was shot dead by her uncle. Mr Khan went to police to register a case against his brother. Another police official, Ali Akbar, said they were now attempting to arrest the killer. \\'We have registered a case against him and are making efforts to trace him,\\' the policeman said. Police said they were not aware of any family feud leading up to the attack. In Pakistan\\'s highly patriarchal and often violent society, women are frequently killed over minor issues or so-called matters of \\'honour\\'. The Aurat Foundation, a campaign group that works to improve women\\'s lives in Pakistan, says more than 3,000 have been killed for \\'honour\\' since 2008.\\n\\nWhat are highlight points?\\nAnswer: Rehana Bibi fought her uncle when he demanded she turn off her music. He shot her twice, once in the head and once in the face, then fled. Police are now making efforts to track down the killer.\\nText: By. Daily Mail Reporter. PUBLISHED:. 19:06 EST, 2 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 02:42 EST, 3 October 2013. A murderer who slashed April Jones’ killer Mark Bridger across the face in jail was given another life sentence yesterday. Juvinal Ferreira used a knife he made from a prison-issue Bic razor to cut Bridger on July 7, severing an artery and leaving a wound that needed 30 stitches. Robin Frieze, defending, told Leeds Crown Court that Ferreira hoped the assault in Wakefield jail would make Bridger reveal where he had hidden the body of the five-year-old girl from Machynlleth in mid Wales. Frieze said his client was \\'under the impression that if he put the defendant in a state of fear then it would be more likely that it would achieve closure for the family of his victim\\'. Child killer Mark Bridger (left) was slashed by Juvinal Ferreira (right), who has been given a life sentence for the attack. Bridger, who murdered five year old April Jones, needed 30 stitches. But Mr Justice Coulson said this was not a \\'realistic ground of mitigation\\', adding: \\'Convicted murderers cannot appoint themselves as unpaid investigators of another crime, no matter how serious. \\'They plainly cannot do that by themselves committing violent crimes.\\' Mr Justice Coulson handed Ferreira a life sentence with a minimum term of five years after he pleaded guilty to GBH with intent - meaning that he will now not be considered for release until March 2036. Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, told the court: \\'Bridger’s notorious recent conviction for the murder of April Jones, and the circumstances of that offence, became known to the defendant, and it is that which provided a pretext for this offence, which is a premeditated assault with a weapon resulting in exceptionally serious injury. April was kidnapped and murdered by Mark Bridger, who coaxed her into his car as she played on her bike on October 1 last year. \\'Bridger was transferred to HMP Wakefield in June of this year and since Thursday July 4 he had been permitted association with other prisoners. \\'The first few days had passed without incident. \\'However, his presence had been noted and discussed on the wing, and the defendant decided to attack Bridger. \\'The defendant saw him and walked directly up to him with the blade held between thumb and forefinger. \\'He then slashed him down the face, causing a deep wound extending from temple to chin. \\'He paused for a moment and looked Bridger directly in the eyes - in Bridger’s own words \"as if to admire his work or show me who it was\". Mr Sharp told how Ferreira claimed he had flushed the weapon away but a search found a weapon close by that was very similar to his description. Ferreira initially denied the claim, telling prison officers: \\'What’s up, I’ve done nowt wrong\\', later admitting what he had done. He was born in Guinea and grew up in the Gambia, arriving in the UK in 2007 with his mother and they lived in Dereham in Norfolk in April 2008. It was here that he was \\'frequently observed drunk and behaving in a bizarre and sexually aggressive manner,\\' Mr Sharp told. The court heard he became friendly with a 47-year-old lady named Elaine Walpole, and he began regularly visiting her at her flat. On April 26, 2008 he raped and murdered her in the flat. The court heard her death was as a result of a single stab wound to her neck.\\nHighlights:'},\n",

In a symbolic gesture Mountjoy smashed the O'Neills' inauguration stone at Tullaghogue. Famine soon hit Ulster as a result of the English scorched earth strategy. O'Neill's uirithe or sub-lords  began to surrender and Rory O'Donnell, Hugh Roe's brother and successor, surrendered on terms at the end of 1602. However, with a secure base in the large and dense forests of Tir Eoghain, O'Neill held out until 30 March 1603, when he surrendered on good terms to Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Elizabeth I had died on 24 March. Although the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of West Breifne in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by Brian Óg O'Rourke, one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the Battle of Curlew Pass. He failed to secure any concessions from the treaty as his half-brother Tadhg O'Rourke had fought with the English during the war and was granted lordship of West Breifne in return. Following a twelve-day siege, a force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg, Henry Folliott and Rory O'Donnell eventually brought the area, and thus all of Ireland, under English control on 25 April 1603.\\nWhen did the siege of West Breifne begin?\\nA: 1603-April-13\\n\\nQ: The Syrian economy is based on services, agriculture, oil and industry.

Negative effects of the conflict in Syria continue to take a heavy toll on the Syrian economy. The UN estimates that more than 250,000 people have died, while other sources place the death toll at almost 500,000 (470,000) with 1.2 million people injured. More than 6.3 million people are internally displaced and 4.9 million are officially registered as refugees.

Ezekiel Elliott led the attack with 147 rushing yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries, with 219 total yards from scrimmage. Quarterback Dak Prescott completed 64 percent of his passes for 234 yards and three touchdowns with no interceptions and wasn't sacked, completing passes to eight different receivers and finishing with a 134.0 passer rating. The Dallas offense racked up 501 total yards with Dez Bryant posting 74 receiving yards on a game-leading 7 catches and scored one touchdown. The defense dominated throughout, with constant pressure on the quarterback including five sacks and aggressive pass coverage and run defense which held the 49ers to only 103 rushing yards.

They should be able to pick it up and carry it but it should be of sufficient bulk that it cannot be swallowed. Praise the dog when he chooses his toy over another item that you don\\'t want him to chew on. Do not give toys that resemble inappropriate items; for example do not give your dog an old shoe to chew on because he will not know the difference between the old chew shoe and a brand new pair. If you do find your dog chewing on something inappropriate correct the dog by taking the object away. Direct his attentions to an appropriate chew object and give praise when he chews on said object. Gradually, your dog will learn what objects are his and which are not. When you first use a deterrent, apply a small amount to a piece of tissue or cotton wool. Gently place it directly in your dog’s mouth. Allow him to taste it and then spit it out. If your dog finds the taste unpleasant, he might shake his head, drool or retch. He won’t pick up the piece of tissue or wool again. Ideally, he will have learned the connection between the taste and the odor of the deterrent, and he’ll be more likely to avoid chewing items that smell like it.  Spray the deterrent on all objects that you don’t want your dog to chew. Reapply the deterrent every day for two to four weeks. Deterrents come in many flavors and can be purchased at your neighborhood pet store. Please realize, however, that successful treatment for destructive chewing will require more than just the use of deterrents. Dogs need to learn what they can chew as well as what they can’t chew. Please see our article, Using Taste Deterrents, for more information.\\n\\nWrite an article based on this \"Adjust the action of your guitar’s neck. Try different neck shapes.

It is easy to damage your neck, and you should take your guitar to a trusted repair shop for an easy adjustment. Also high action can be due to other causes such as neck angle, bridge height, and shallow nut slots. These are additional reasons to see a good guitar repair person.  If you cannot afford to have your guitar's action fixed by a repair technician, consider using a capo on the first fret of the guitar as a temporary alternative.  Placing a capo on the first fret helps bring the strings closer to the frets. Some guitars require you to remove the neck to access the truss rod. Neck shapes play a major role in the comfort of playing.  Different brands and styles of guitar offer many neck styles and shapes to their customers. Always try out a guitar before buying it.  Be sure to play it up and down the neck, using both barre and open cords. Similar to buying a new pair of shoes, you want to try out guitars that not only sound great, but also feel right.  For certain models of guitars, such as most Fenders, have bolt-on necks so you can change the neck of your current guitar. Still go to a repair person to do this because there is some fine fitting involved. Other instruments, such as most Gibsons, have glued-in necks and changing the neck can be a costly process. Fat necks are usually viewed in the guitar world as sturdy and reliable necks. This style of neck could be difficult for beginners. Try out several styles of necks before making any decisions. Prepare for soreness and stiffness. With that in mind, a novice guitarist should not expect to have the same level of stamina exhibited by a more experienced guitarist.  If pain in your fretting hand persists for longer than two days, you should let a doctor examine your hand.   Your body lets you know something is wrong whenever pain becomes acute.  Unlike weightlifting, where some pain is gain, in the guitar world persistent pain could mean trouble.\"}]},\n",

It was the £1.6million cocaine racket hatched by a 'gang of four' Britons that has left one of them facing death by firing squad in Bali. But on May 17 last year, when Lindsay Sandiford allegedly met two members of the syndicate at a hotel in Bangkok, she must have  appeared an ordinary middle-aged woman living a relatively mundane life. Her world was to be totally shattered by the events of the next 48 hours. At the hotel, prosecutors say she met Rachel Dougall and Paul. Beales, both 39, to arrange for her to courier the cocaine to Bali. Unmasked: Briton Lindsay Sandiford covers her face days after customs. officials found her carrying 5kg or cocaine and then showed the haul to. the press. Sentence: Today the grandmother was put on death row and another member of the gang she helped police catch could receive the same tomorrow. Beales, Sandiford claims, was the man who placed 5kg of cocaine in the lining of her suitcase. She was later to tell the police that the actual owner of the drugs was Dougall though both were later to deny these accusations. Whatever the truth, the Gloucestershire grandmother was to fly to Bali two days later carrying £1.6million of cocaine. She was intercepted at Denpasar airport, the. main airport on the Indonesian island, where customs officials X-rayed the. suitcase, found the drugs and arrested her. In custody, eating a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice, Sandiford cracked as soon as she was told she would be executed if convicted. She immediately confessed that she had been told to hand over the drugs. to Dougall and her partner, Brighton antiques restorer Julian Ponder, 43. The couple were known as the ‘King and. Queen’ of Bali as they managed to afford the £1,000-a-week rent on their. palatial villa without seemingly working. Insisting that she was just. a mule, Sandiford also claimed she was forced to be a courier because of threats against her children in Britain. Police then set up a sting operation, and followed the grandmother as she went. about contacting Dougall, Ponder,. and Beales. King and queen: Couple Rachel Dougall, 39, and Julian Ponder, 43, became well known in Bali for their lavish lifestyle but they were eventually arrested and accused of forming a drugs syndicate. Fourth Man: Paul Beales, right, was also arrested on suspicion of being the 'muscle' of the group and given four years in jail last month. They sent Sandiford to a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was. accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be. contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate. Police claim Ponder turned up at the. hotel while Beales, whom they believe was the. gang's 'muscle', waited nearby. Both were arrested and Dougall was also taken into custody. All three denied the charges and despite Sandiford's evidence, the. case against Dougall and Beales was soon to crumble when officers failed. to find any concrete evidence connecting the suspects. Police sources said that all. conversations between Dougall and Sandiford were carried out through. mobile phones. But officers had failed. to retrieve a SIM card during a raid on Dougall’s Bali villa,. meaning there was no physical evidence. Dougall received a one-year jail sentence in the Denpasar District Court. last month for hiding the crime. She could be on her way back to the UK by April, to be. reunited with her daughter, because she had already been in jail for. eight months awaiting trial. At the time of her arrest, Dougall insisted she was the victim of a 'fit-up',. Beales, a long-time Bali resident, was also spared a harsh sentence when. judges gave him four years for possession of a small amount of. hashish. Case: This is the villa in Bali used as the home of Rachel Dougall and Julian Ponder, Britons also arrested and accused of drug smuggling £1.6million of cocaine. The fourth Briton, Ponder, is accused of being one of the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on the island. Ponder. said he simply thought Mrs Sandiford was bringing a present for his. daughter’s sixth birthday. ‘Julian. Ponder believes 100 per cent that he was trapped by Lindsay,’ his. lawyer said at the time. Ponder reportedly said he thought the gift-wrapped. packages, bearing the words 'Enjoy Sweet Candy' were sweets for his. little daughter. 'I was the subject of entrapment by Lindsay, who knew my daughter was going to be six shortly after her arrival,' he said. 'Having. been caught she aided the police surveillance and brought the cocaine. to me wrapped as if it was a present for my daughter. I never touched. the drugs.' Today Lindsay Sandiford burst in to tears and cried 'no, no, no' as she was sentenced to death in a Bali court. A. verdict is expected in the trial of Ponder as early as tomorrow, where. he could be given the same sentence, which would make him the 13th. Briton abroad facing the death penalty. Shock: British citizen Lindsay Sandiford listens to her interpreter as she is sentenced to death by Indonesian judges today.\\n\\nanswer:\"},\n",

A technology developed by Crown Holdings for the 2010 FIFA World Cup is the \\'full aperture\\' can, so named because the entire lid is removed during the opening process, turning the can into a drinking cup. Cans protect the beer from light (thereby preventing \"skunked\" beer) and have a seal less prone to leaking over time than bottles. Cans were initially viewed as a technological breakthrough for maintaining the quality of a beer, then became commonly associated with less expensive, mass-produced beers, even though the quality of storage in cans is much like bottles. Plastic (PET) bottles are used by some breweries.\\nQuestion: What does PET stand for?\\n\\nOutput: unanswerable\\n\\n\\nInput: Read this: Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília. The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into superquadras (\"superblocks\"): groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools, retail stores, and open spaces. At the northern end of Lake Paranoá, separated from the inner city, is a peninsula with many fashionable homes, and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore. Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the artificial lake, but during early development private clubs, hotels, and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water. Set well apart from the city are satellite cities, including Gama, Ceilândia, Taguatinga, Núcleo Bandeirante, Sobradinho, and Planaltina. These cities, with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned.\\nQuestion: Where is there a peninsula with luxury homes?\\n\\nOutput: the northern end of Lake Paranoá\\n\\n\\nInput: Read this: Environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time. The contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology, and arguably at least the backdrop, if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today, is political ecology. Many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture, politics and power, globalization, localized issues, and more. The focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for/against or creation of policy, and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land. Often, the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly (organizing, participation) or indirectly (articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies). Such is the case with environmental justice advocate Melissa Checker and her relationship with the people of Hyde Park.\\nQuestion: What was the first focus of field work in environmental anthropology?\\n\\nOutput:'},\n",

Investigators say the blaze that badly burnt God\\'s Power Church of Christ in Macon, Ga., was not caused by likely problems such as electrical malfunction, and WBTV reports that a fire at Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, NC, has already been ruled arson. The pastor there, Mannix Kinsey, says he forgives the arsonist and hopes it won\\'t be deemed a hate crime: \"Just the climate,\" he says. \"We all have to consider what else ... we need to do to actually be able to work together.\" Among other church fires, mostly in southern states, local and federal officers are looking blazes in Warrenville, South Carolina, and Knoxville, Tenn. Green notes that arson cases increased at black American churches in the mid-to-late 20th century, but reporting standards today make it harder to track more recent church arsons. Marking a blaze a hate crime is harder still, says a staffer at the National Fire Protection Association, because then \"you either have to know who did it or they have to leave you a message in some way that makes it very obvious. There are an awful lot ... that are not hate crimes—they’re run-of-the-mill kids doing stupid things.\" Indeed, investigators at the Macon fire have already deemed it arson but say there\\'s no evidence of a hate crime, the AP reports.'}]},\n",

Leon Quarless was arrested after he had been handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers on a flight from Palma, Majorca, to Blackpool. A drunk man who handed out money to fellow passengers on a flight from Majorca has lost nearly £5,000 which he had on him at the time. Police have claimed Leon Quarless, 46, who was arrested after his Jet2 flight from Palma, Majorca, touched down at its destination in Blackpool, Lancashire, had the money because he was involved in drug dealing. During the flight the pilot had radioed ahead and reported how Quarless had been drinking and then went up and down the aisle handing out £20 notes and Euros to other passengers. He was later fined in June last year £320 for being drunk on an aircraft. Now, a court has ruled police can keep the rest of the money which was found on him - a total of £4,972. Following his initial fine, Lancashire Police started a Proceeds of Crime Act into Quarless, from Formby, Merseyside, Blackpool Magistrates heard. Police financial investigator Alan Todd told how when Quarless was questioned about his money giveaway he suddenly removed a SIM card from his phone and put it in his mouth and crunched it up with his teeth. He was also found to be carrying a driving licence under the name Joseph Noone. The investigator told the court: \\'This man does not appear to have a job. The Inland Revenue has never heard of him and has no records on him whatsoever. \\'He has however boarded 50 flights in two years out of the UK mostly to Spain and Holland. \\'£70,000 in cash has gone through his various bank accounts during that time. \\'Merseyside Police have intelligence that he may be involved in drugs and we believe this money has come about because of drug dealing.\\' Prosecutor Sue McLane said : \\'It is fair to say that if this money we wish to seize came about legally he would have been banging on our doors to ask for it back.\\' Magistrates agreed to the seizure of the money found on Quarless which will now be going into a real charity fund run by the Chief Constable.

The buildup to Saturday night\\'s live final had been dominated by reports that Boyle lost her temper in a London hotel and had even considered pulling out of the talent show finale. The Mail on Sunday said she had been been \"comforted by psychiatrists\" ahead of Saturday\\'s final. \"They have a whole army of doctors, psychiatrists and experts all available to any contestant at any time. They have all been taking great care of Susan,\" the paper quoted \"Britain\\'s Got Talent\" judge Piers Morgan as saying.  Watch how Boyle\\'s rise to fame has been an emotional ride ». In Scotland, where crowds had gathered in Boyle\\'s hometown of Blackburn in anticipation of victory, celebration parties were stopped in their tracks as the unexpected result was announced. \"Boyle foiled in final: Susan\\'s dream is over,\" said the headline in the Sunday Mail. Earlier, the paper said, Blackburn\\'s community center had been \"a sea of hands\" as Boyle performed her signature tune, \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from the musical \"Les Miserables.\" \"They stood with tears in their eyes as Susan hit every note. Stamping and chanting her name, her fellow villagers could not have been more proud.\"  Watch the dramatic end to Susan Boyle\\'s dream ». But \"the cheers were caught in the collective gullet ... as dance troupe Diversity gatecrashed this most expectant of parties,\" the Sunday Herald reported. \"Jaws were left agape. Tears were shed. And then the supportive chanting of \\'SuBo\\' began again.\" Boyle could still be the real winner from the series, which became a global hit after clips of her audition of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" racked up millions of hits on YouTube. Did Susan deserve to win? Sound Off below. \"£6M superstar\" said the Sunday Mirror, claiming that \"Britain\\'s Got Talent\" impresario Simon Cowell plans to take Boyle across the Atlantic to \"conquer the U.S.\" The News of the World upped Boyle\\'s likely earnings on the back of \"Britain\\'s Got Talent\" to £8 million ($13 million). On top of a multi-million dollar record deal and share of album sales, Boyle is also set to earn from a Hollywood movie of her rags-to-riches life, a book deal, and millions more from image rights, endorsements and television appearances, the paper said. In an interview with the News of the World, Cowell said Boyle could be the biggest star he had ever discovered. \"They don\\'t care in America whether she wins a British TV show -- they care about the woman they saw singing on YouTube,\" a Cowell insider also told the paper. \"If anything, £8 million in her first year might be an underestimate.\" Meanwhile, competition winners Diversity are also set to cash in on their success with a film deal and a possible slot supporting Michael Jackson when the superstar plays a series of shows in London next month, the Sunday Mirror said. The group collected £100,000 ($162,000) for winning the final and will perform in front of Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Show later this year. \"We feel electric. Words can\\'t describe it.

While some researchers sometimes use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race often is used in a naive or simplistic way,[page needed] and argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance by pointing out that all living humans belong to the same species, Homo sapiens, and subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens. \\n\\nThere is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed, and that racial groups cannot be biologically defined. Nonetheless, some scholars argue that racial categories obviously correlate with biological traits (e.g. phenotype) to some degree, and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations, some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings. For this reason, there is no current consensus about whether racial categories can be considered to have significance for understanding human genetic variation. 1. What is in wide consensus?\\n2.

My experience with this company has left my family strained and baffled. How could so much damage be done to our lives and our new home in such a short time? Their \"under warranty\" washer flooded our new home, ruining the entire lower floor, Their response was to tell us to contact our insurance co. we had already done that! They don\\'t cover machine operation failures! Priority responded by sending over some ogre to rip up carpet, padding, baseboard, door jam trim, kitchen kickboards and drill holes every few inches along the bottom of the wallboard. They left l behind huge blowers running 24/7 for 5days. We had debris piled in the back yard for a week. It was like living in hell. All the destruction and heat in Vegas, in the summer!  They sent a technician to haul away the machine/evidence and haven\\'t replaced it or refunded my money since.  After that, it was a waiting game. a month went by while they sifted through \"their vendors\" to find the cheapest. We had to meet with 5 different \"handymen\" before one was cheap enough for their liking. After a month and 1/2 of our furniture in the garage, bugs coming in through the holes in the walls, and eating standing at the counter, they sent someone to replace our beautiful carpet and pad with the very cheapest they could get. It is rough and bumpy and doesnt match. The linoleum they put in is crap too. This is our home, the palce we come to for refuge.  Their \"vendor\" who replaced the baseboard, and trim was worse. Nothing matched the rest of the house. They painted the baseboard a different color, getting it all over the walls as they went. So I have 2 colors of brush marks all over the walls that dont match, and door trim that is a different color on top from the sides, and two cans of paint that they left my son to fix their mistakes that don\\'t match either. Where they couldn\\'t cover the holes in the walls, they just left them showing.  Had I been able to hang around and make sure everything was done properly, I might have had some control, but Priority was going to make me pay one way or another. How dare I buy a faulty machine from them! I figure these guys devalued our home by about 10 thousand dollars. Do yourself a favor STAY AWAY! They are a mickey mouse operation with no service values at all. None of them would live in a house in the condition that mine is, now, in but it\\'s okay for a customer that bought in good faith.  They are, also, in the property management business, Priority Property Management. Can you imagine how many investment properties they have devalued using \"their vendors?\"  Just think of the shortened life span of a piece of investment property exposed to constant reworking by amateurs.

Formerly commanded by such legendary admirals as Dmitriy Senyavin and Pavel Nakhimov, it is a fleet of enormous historical and political importance for Russia. In 1790, Russian naval forces under the command of Admiral Fyodor Ushakov defeated the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Kerch Strait. From 1841 onward, the fleet was confined to the Black Sea by the London Straits Convention. As a result of the Crimean War, one provision of the Treaty of Paris was that the Black Sea was to be a demilitarized zone like the Island of Åland in the Baltic Sea, although Russia subsequently renounced the treaty and reconstituted its naval strength and fortifications in the Black Sea. The crew of the battleship Potemkin revolted in 1905 soon after the Navy's defeat in the Russo-Japanese War. Lenin wrote that the Potemkin uprising had had a huge importance in terms of being the first attempt at creating the nucleus of a revolutionary army. During World War I, there were a number of encounters between the Russian and Ottoman navies in the Black Sea. The Ottomans initially had the advantage due to their having under their command the German battlecruiser SMS\\xa0Goeben, but after the two modern Russian dreadnoughts Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya had been built in Mykolaiv, the Russians took command of the sea until the Russian government collapsed in November 1917.

Pittsburgh delivered the opening strike in the first quarter as running back Rashard Mendenhall got a 1-yard touchdown run, followed by a 25-yard field goal from kicker Jeff Reed.  The Bengals answered in the second quarter as quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens, yet the Steelers responded with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hooking up with wide receiver Hines Ward on an 8-yard touchdown pass, followed by Reed's 53-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, Pittsburgh added onto their lead in the fourth quarter as wide receiver Antwaan Randle El found wide receiver Mike Wallace on a 39-yard touchdown pass.  Cincinnati tried to rally as Palmer completed a 27-yard touchdown pass to Owens, followed by running back Cedric Benson getting a 1-yard touchdown run, thanks in no small part to two consecutive penalties called against the Steelers, both of which were later deemed by the NFL to have been incorrect.  Fortunately, the defense held on to preserve the victory.\\nWhat all field goals did Jeff Reed make?\\n\\nA: 25-yard\\n\\n\\nP: Riding high from their home upset over the Seahawks, the 49ers flew to the Edward Jones Dome for an NFC West rematch with their historic rival, the St. Louis Rams.  After a scoreless first quarter, the Niners trailed early.  In the second quarter, the Rams struck first with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 24-yard field goal, while RB Steven Jackson got a 36-yard TD run.  San Francisco would get on the board with RB Frank Gore getting a 12-yard TD run, yet Wilkins gave St. Louis a 51-yard field goal as time ran out on the half.  In the third quarter, the 49ers took the lead as QB Alex Smith completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE Eric Johnson for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, kicker Joe Nedney gave the Niners a six-point lead with a 24-yard field goal.  However, the Rams would get the win with QB Marc Bulger completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis.

She successfully \"crossed over\" to pop music and was one of the most influential, successful, and acclaimed vocalists of the 20th century. She died at age 30 in the crash of a private airplane. Cline was known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice, and her role as a country music pioneer.\\nPatsy Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley on September 8, 1932 in Winchester, Virginia, in the city\\'s Memorial Hospital. She was the eldest child of seamstress Hilda Virginia (nee Patterson, 1916-1998) and blacksmith Samuel Lawrence Hensley (1889-1956). She had a brother Samuel Jr. (1939-2004) and a sister Sylvia. The family moved often before finally settling in Winchester, Virginia when Patsy was 16. Sam Hensley deserted his family in 1947, but the children\\'s home was reportedly happy nonetheless.  When Patsy was 13, she was hospitalized with a throat infection and rheumatic fever. She later said, \"The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like Kate Smith.\"  Cline enrolled at John Handley High School but never attended classes. To help her mother support their family, she worked as a soda jerk at Gaunt\\'s Drug Store and a waitress at the Triangle Diner. She watched performers through the window at the local radio station, and she asked WINC (AM) disc jockey Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs wearing fringed Western outfits that her mother made from Patsy\\'s designs.  Cline performed in variety and talent shows in the Winchester and Tri-State areas, and she gained a large following through the shows and local radio appearances. Jimmy Dean was already a country star in 1954, and she became a regular with him on Connie B. Gay\\'s Town and Country Jamboree radio show on WAVA (AM) in Arlington County, Virginia.\\n\\nhow did it change her voice?\\n\\nThe fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like Kate Smith.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnswer the question at the end by quoting:\\n\\nEnrique Pena Nieto was born on 20 July 1966 in Atlacomulco, State of Mexico, a city 55 miles (89 km) northwest of Mexico City. He is the oldest of four siblings; his father, Gilberto Enrique Pena del Mazo, was an electrical engineer; his mother, Maria del Perpetuo Socorro Ofelia Nieto Sanchez, a schoolteacher. He is the nephew of two former governors of the State of Mexico: on his mother\\'s side, Arturo Montiel (whom business magazine Forbes listed in 2013, as one of the ten most corrupt Mexican politicians); on his father\\'s, Alfredo del Mazo Gonzalez.\\nWhile campaigning, Pena Nieto appointed a former general of the National Police of Colombia as his external advisor for public security, and boldly promised to reduce the murder rate in Mexico by 50% by the end of his six-year term. Critics of Pena Nieto\\'s security strategy, however, said that he offered \"little sense\" in exactly how he will reduce the violence. During the three-month campaign, Pena Nieto was not explicit on his anti-crime strategy, and many analysts wondered whether he was holding back politically sensitive details or simply did not know how he would attempt to squelch the violence and carry out the next stage in Mexico\\'s drug war. United States officials were worried that the election of Pena Nieto\\'s Institutional Revolutionary Party may mean a return to the old PRI tactics of \"corruption [and] backroom deals\" with the cartels in exchange for bribes and relative peace.  In 2012, the president-elect emphasized that he did not support the involvement or presence of armed United States agents in Mexico, but considered allowing the United States to instruct Mexico\\'s military training in counterinsurgency tactics. Beyond that, Pena Nieto promised that no other measures will be taken by the United States in Mexico.  The security policy of Pena Nieto has prioritized the reduction of violence rather than attacking Mexico\\'s drug-trafficking organizations head-on, marking a departure from the strategy of the previous six years during Felipe Calderon\\'s administration. One of the biggest contrasts is the focus on lowering murder rates, kidnappings, and extortions, as opposed to arresting or killing the country\\'s most-wanted drug lords and intercepting their drug shipments. The government of Calderon justified its position by stating that the violence in the country was a necessary stage in Mexico\\'s drug war, as weakening criminal groups fought for territorial control against one another and the government.  On 13 December 2012, a law was approved that included far-reaching security reforms. Mexico\\'s Interior Ministry, greatly strengthened by the bill, was made solely responsible for public security. Part of Pena Nieto\\'s strategy consists of the creation of a national police of 40,000 members, known as a \"gendarmerie\". The Economist reported that the gendarmerie would have an initial strength of 10,000, but the Washington Office on Latin America reported that it was reduced to 5,000 members and would not be operational until July 2014. The Interior Ministry announced that 15 specialized police units were being formed to exclusively focus on major crimes that include kidnapping and extortion, along with a new task force dedicated to tracking missing persons. Pena Nieto also proposed centralizing the sub-federal police forces under one command.\\n\\nWhat is the gendarmerie going to do\\n\\nThe Interior Ministry announced that 15 specialized police units were being formed to exclusively focus on major crimes that include kidnapping and extortion,\\n\\n\\n\\nAnswer the question at the end by quoting:\\n\\nTu Youyou (Chinese: Tu You You ; pinyin: Tu Youyou; born 30 December 1930) is a Chinese pharmaceutical chemist and educator. She is best known for discovering artemisinin (also known as qinghaosu) and dihydroartemisinin, used to treat malaria, which has saved millions of lives.\\nTu Youyou was born in Ningbo, Zhejiang, China on 30 December 1930. She attended Xiaoshi Middle School for junior high school and the first year of high school, before transferring to Ningbo Middle School in 1948. From 1951 to 1955, she attended Peking University Medical School / Beijing Medical College. Tu studied at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and graduated in 1955. Later Tu was trained for two and a half years in traditional Chinese medicine.  After graduation, Tu worked at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (now the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences) in Beijing. She was promoted to a Researcher (Yan Jiu Yuan , the highest researcher rank in mainland China equivalent to the academic rank of a full professor) in 1980 shortly after the Chinese economic reform began in 1978. In 2001 she was promoted to academic advisor for doctoral candidates. Currently she is the Chief Scientist in the Academy.  As of 2007, her office is in an old apartment building in Dongcheng District, Beijing.  Before 2011, Tu Youyou had been obscure for decades, and is described as \"almost completely forgotten by people\".  Tu is regarded as the Professor of Three Noes - no postgraduate degree (there was no postgraduate education then in China), no study or research experience abroad, and not a member of any Chinese national academies, i.e. Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of Engineering. Up until 1979, there were no postgraduate degree programs in China, and China was largely isolated from the rest of the world. Tu is now regarded as a representative figure of the first generation of Chinese medical workers since the establishment of the People\\'s Republic of China in 1949.\\n\\nWhere did she work after this\\n\\n'},\n",

Nutritional deficiencies have been shown to have a negative effect on learning behavior in mice as far back as 1951.\\n\\nNow answer this question: Which animal was shown to have a negative effect on learning behavior due to nutritional deficiencies back in 1951?\\n\\nOutput: mice\\n\\nInput: Article: In boundary scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs on the board form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard test configuration procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) standard. The JTAG test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes. JTAG tool vendors provide various types of stimulus and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.\\n\\nNow answer this question: Do test circuits create permanent or temporary connections between traces?\\n\\nOutput:\"},\n",

The power supplied to the antenna terminals which is not radiated is converted into heat. This is usually through loss resistance in the antenna\\'s conductors, but can also be due to dielectric or magnetic core losses in antennas (or antenna systems) using such components. Such loss effectively robs power from the transmitter, requiring a stronger transmitter in order to transmit a signal of a given strength.\\nTry to answer this question if possible: What can cause that reaction?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

The same process is at work the same as it was billions of years ago. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time. Some organisms may not be able to adapt. They become extinct. Becoming extinct means they die out completely. Some geologists study the history of the Earth. They want to learn about Earths past. They use clues from rocks and fossils. They use these clues to make sense of events. The goal is to place things in the order they happened.

The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. \\n\\nQuestion: \"Breathing process depends on which muscle\"\\n\\nAnswer: \"Biceps\"\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\nAnswer: no\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nOver the centuries, the living here has always been easy enough to attract a steady stream of immigrants.

On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family.

Thats right, wires that carry electric current. These wires carry electric current to your home. But what is electric current? Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires. \\n\"Does an electric current run through the wires atop the tall poles along the roadside?\" is \"No it doesn\\'t\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\nOutput: no\\n\\n\\nInput: New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas\\u2002—\\u2002corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn\\'s penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked\\u2002—\\u2002then ordered\\u2002—\\u2002to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes\\' legendary three-year, $300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes\\' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes\\' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties\\u2002—\\u2002the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them\\u2002—\\u2002and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort\\u2002—\\u2002Mirage\\u2002—\\u2002 which became an instant success. \\n\\nDoes the response \"Golden Nugget\" correctly answer the question \"The owner of the Golden Nugget demolished several Strip properties to build what?\"?\\n\\nOPTIONS:\\n- no\\n- yes\\n***\\nOutput:'},\n",

The president\\'s plan would cap payments on federal loans at 10% of a borrower\\'s income above a set minimum, defined as 150% of the poverty level for the borrower\\'s family, and allow loans to be forgiven after 20 years instead of 25.\\n\\nFor borrowers with a family of four, the federal poverty level is $22,050. Under the president\\'s plan someone who earns less than 150% of that amount, or $33,075, would owe nothing on a monthly basis. Those with higher incomes would have monthly student loan payments that equal 10% of their income above $33,075.\\n\\nFollow Forbes MoneyBuilder on Twitter\\n\\nCurrently borrowers can apply for income-based repayment plans that cap student loan payments at 15% of their income above the basic poverty level. A person who makes less than 150% of the poverty level will not have to make any monthly payments, though they will still be liable to repay the principal and interest charges will continue to grow.\\n\\nIf enacted, the new policy would cost the federal government as much as $1 billion over five years, according to Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert and publisher of FinAid. It would apply to Direct, Stafford, Grad Plus and consolidation loans but would not be available for private student loans.\\n\\nUnder the new plan a borrower with an adjusted gross income of $30,000 who owes $40,000 in student loans would pay about $115 a month to service his student debt, down from $170 a month under the current system.\\n\\nBoth figures are well below the burden a borrower would face in the absence of income-based repayment caps. To pay off a $40,000 debt without such caps over the standard 10-year loan period requires payments of $460 a month, assuming a fixed 6.8% interest rate.\\n\\nUnder the current income-based repayment system, a person\\'s monthly payments rise along with his income. Any debt not paid off after 25 years is forgiven, although the government regards the forgiven balance as income for tax purposes.\\n\\nThose who go into government work receive additional benefits under income-based repayment. Public health workers, law enforcement officers, public school teachers and other government employees can stop making payments on federal student loans after only 10 years. Any unpaid balance is forgiven with no taxes due.

       "    'content': 'Q: R.I.C.E. stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. This principle can be used at home to treat forearm Tendinitis and should be practiced on a daily basis for the best results. Resting the muscles in the affected tendons is crucial to treating Tendinitis, especially in athletes. Athletes who continue to push through tendon pain risk escalating their injury from the acute inflammation phase to chronic Tendinitis, which is much harder to treat.  Avoid in sports or strenuous physical activity. Don’t try to play through the pain. Small amounts of activity can still be done by patients with forearm tendinitis. Complete abstinence from using the affected area can cause muscle stiffness. Try low impact activities like swimming and gentle stretches to keep your muscles active without putting too much stress or use on them. Use an ice pack, wrapped in a towel, or give your forearm an ice massage, or a slush bath with ice and water. This will decrease the pain, muscle spasms, and swelling of your forearm.  To apply an ice massage, freeze a plastic foam cup of water. Hold the cup while applying the ice directly to the skin of your forearm. You can use frozen bag of vegetables such as peas. Swelling can result in a loss of motion in the injured joint. Use a compression wrap or a compressive elastic bandage (available at any pharmacy) on your forearm until it appears less swollen. Elevating your forearm will help to reduce the pain and swelling. Raise the affected forearm above the level of your heart on a chair or a stack of pillows. Ibuprofen, Aspirin or other anti-inflammatory medication will help with the pain and swelling in the short term (five to seven days).  Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) is a very effective pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medication. You can usually take two pills at a time, and repeat every four to six hours. Naproxen sodium (Aleve) is another anti-inflammatory medication. You may take this every 12 hours as needed for pain and swelling. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is another effective pain reliever that can be used to ease the discomfort associated with forearm tendinitis.\\nA: Follow R.I.C.E. Rest the your forearm. Ice the injured area for up to 20 minutes, several times a day. Compress the area until the swelling goes down. Elevate the affected area. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever or anti-inflammatory medication.\\n\\nArticle: The way you plan to style your hair daily is extremely important information for your barber. Ultimately, they’ll need to know what you want to do so they can make it possible. Let them know if you plan to:  Slick your hair back Part it down the middle Style it with hair gel in sort of a messy look. If you want something more than a simple cut, you should let the barber know the name of the cut. This might require you doing a little homework about the hair style you want or talking to other stylists or barbers. By bringing a picture of either you or someone else with the haircut you want, you’ll give your barber a clear idea of what you want them to do with your hair. Without a picture, they’ll have an incomplete account of what you want. Flip through magazines like People, GQ, Men’s Health, or similar titles to find a picture of someone with the haircut you want. If you’re not exactly sure of what you want, you should probably ask your barber for their opinion. Ultimately, as a professional who cuts people’s hair all day, they’ll have a really good idea of what will look good on you and what won’t. All you need to do is ask. After the barber cuts your hair, you may need to ask them to make a few adjustments. This is normal, and you shouldn’t be ashamed to ask. Simply state, in a polite way, that you’d like them to fix something.  If your hair is too long, ask them to shorten it a little bit. Say, “It seems a little long, can we shorten it a touch?” If it didn’t turn out the way you thought it would, say something like “I don’t think it looks exactly the way I imagined. Is there something we can do to tweak it a little?”\\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\\nExplain how you will wear your hair every day. Inform them of the name of the haircut you want, if you know it. Bring a picture. Ask for advice. Point out things you want changed.\\n\\nQ: If a bunch of people are together talking and you want to join the group, hang back for a moment and listen in to the conversation. You don’t need to walk up and contribute right away. Wait until you’re caught up on what’s being discussed, then chime in with a question or a statement. For example, if people are talking about sports, say, “I couldn’t believe the game last night!” If people are talking about school, say, “Who else has an exam tomorrow?” Especially if it’s a big party, it’s likely that people will break off into smaller groups. Suggest a card game or board game and invite people to play with you. It may be easy to talk to people while you play the game and being in a smaller circle can make you feel more comfortable.  Put on some music and get people to dance. Ask people you don’t know, “Do you want to play cards? We’re getting some teams together.” If you successfully join a conversation with other people and someone new walks up, invite them to join the conversation. Let them know what everyone is discussing or invite them to contribute to the discussion. For example, say, “Tim just got a puppy and we’re discussing dogs. What do you think about having a puppy?”\\nA:'},\n",

Jeremiah Fogel, 57, was taken into custody following the incident at the Greater Faith Christian Church, the sheriff\\'s office said in a statement.  Fogel is also suspected of shooting and killing his wife at their residence before going to the church, police said. Fogel walked to the front of the church during a prayer meeting between the morning services and specifically opened fire on church clergy, said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. \"Pastor William Boss was shot once in the head,\" Judd said.  \"At that time everyone jumped up, and he went over to the left side of the church and shot the assistant minister Carl Stewart three times.\" After Fogel opened fire, parishioners Derek Foster and Corey Reid grabbed the gun from him, hit him in the head with a nightstand and held him to the ground, according to Judd. Boss and Stewart were being treated at Lakeland Regional Medical Center. Judd said police are trying to determine a motive behind the shooting. \"Obviously there was a conflict with his wife and/or some people in church,\" Judd said. \"We\\'re trying to find out exactly what forced him to go into his killing rage on a Sunday morning.\" Authorities received a 911 call regarding a gunman in the church at 9:58 a.m. Sunday, the sheriff\\'s office said.

       "    'content': 'Answer the question at the end by quoting:\\n\\nGeorge Michael Cohan (July 3, 1878 - November 5, 1942), known professionally as George M. Cohan, was an American entertainer, playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, dancer and producer. Cohan began his career as a child, performing with his parents and sister in a vaudeville act known as \"The Four Cohans.\" Beginning with Little Johnny Jones in 1904, he wrote, composed, produced, and appeared in more than three dozen Broadway musicals. Cohan published more than 300 songs during his lifetime, including the standards \"Over There\", \"Give My Regards to Broadway\", \"The Yankee Doodle Boy\" and \"You\\'re a Grand Old Flag\".\\nFrom 1899 to 1907, Cohan was married to Ethel Levey (1881-1955; born Grace Ethelia Fowler), a musical comedy actress and dancer. Levey and Cohan had a daughter, actress Georgette Cohan Souther Rowse (1900-1988). Levey joined the Four Cohans when Josie married, and she starred in Little Johnny Jones and other Cohan works. In 1907, Levey divorced Cohan on grounds of adultery.  In 1908, Cohan married Agnes Mary Nolan (1883-1972), who had been a dancer in his early shows; they remained married until his death. They had two daughters and a son. The eldest was Mary Cohan Ronkin, a cabaret singer in the 1930s, who composed incidental music for her father\\'s play The Tavern. In 1968, Mary supervised musical and lyric revisions for the musical George M!. Their second daughter was Helen Cohan Carola, a film actress, who performed on Broadway with her father in Friendship in 1931. Their youngest child was George Michael Cohan, Jr. (1914-2000), who graduated from Georgetown University and served in the entertainment corps during World War II. In the 1950s, George Jr. reinterpreted his father\\'s songs on recordings, in a nightclub act, and in television appearances on the Ed Sullivan and Milton Berle shows. George Jr.\\'s only child, Michaela Marie Cohan (1943-1999), was the last descendant named Cohan. She graduated with a theater degree from Marywood College, Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 1965. From 1966 to 1968, she served in a civilian Special Services unit in Vietnam and Korea. In 1996, she stood in for her ailing father at the ceremony marking her grandfather\\'s induction into the Musical Theatre Hall of Fame at New York University.  Cohan was a devoted baseball fan, regularly attending games of the former New York Giants.  He died of cancer at the age of 64 on November 5, 1942, at his Manhattan apartment on Fifth Avenue, surrounded by family and friends. He received his last rites from Mgr. John J. Casey, representing Archbishop Francis Spellman, and Rev. Francis X. Shea, vicar of the Archdiocese of New York. His funeral was held at St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral, New York and was attended by thousands of people, including five governors of New York, two mayors of New York City and the Postmaster General. The honorary pallbearers included Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, Frank Crowninshield, Sol Bloom, Brooks Atkinson, Rube Goldberg, Walter Huston, George Jessel, Connie Mack, Joseph McCarthy, Eugene O\\'Neill, Sigmund Romberg, Lee Shubert and Fred Waring. Cohan was interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City, in a private family mausoleum he had erected a quarter century earlier for his sister and parents.\\n\\nHow did he die?\\n\\nHe died of cancer at the age of 64 on November 5, 1942, at his Manhattan apartment on Fifth Avenue,\\nIN: James Butler Hickok was born May 27, 1837, in Homer, Illinois (present-day Troy Grove, Illinois) to William Alonzo Hickok, a farmer and abolitionist, and his wife Polly Butler. His father was said to have used the family house, now demolished, as a station on the Underground Railroad. He was the fourth of six children.\\n\\nIn 1873, Buffalo Bill Cody and Texas Jack Omohundro invited Hickok to join their troupe after their earlier success. Hickok did not enjoy acting, often hiding behind scenery, and in one show shot the spotlight when it focused on him. He was released from the group after a few months.  In 1876, Hickok was diagnosed by a doctor in Kansas City, Missouri, with glaucoma and ophthalmia. Though he was just 39, his marksmanship and health were apparently in decline, as he had been arrested several times for vagrancy, despite earning a good income from gambling and displays of showmanship only a few years earlier.  On March 5, 1876, Hickok married Agnes Thatcher Lake, a 50-year-old circus proprietor in Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. Hickok left his new bride a few months later, joining Charlie Utter\\'s wagon train to seek his fortune in the goldfields of South Dakota. Martha Jane Cannary, known popularly as Calamity Jane, claimed in her autobiography that she was married to Hickok and had divorced him so he could be free to marry Agnes Lake, but no records have been found that support her account. The two possibly met for the first time after Jane was released from the guardhouse in Fort Laramie and joined the wagon train in which Hickok was traveling. The wagon train arrived in Deadwood in July 1876. Jane confirmed this account in an 1896 newspaper interview, although she claimed she had been hospitalized with illness rather than in the guardhouse.  Shortly before Hickok\\'s death, he wrote a letter to his new wife, which read in part, \"Agnes Darling, if such should be we never meet again, while firing my last shot, I will gently breathe the name of my wife--Agnes--and with wishes even for my enemies I will make the plunge and try to swim to the other shore.\"\\n\\nWhat did he do after joining Charlie\\'s wagon train ?\\n\\nOUT:'},\n",

In the first quarter, Indianapolis got onto the scoreboard first with QB Peyton Manning completing a 34-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Wayne, while RB Joseph Addai got a 1-yard TD run. Afterwards, Manning and Addai hooked up with each other on a 19-yard TD pass, while rookie CB Michael Coe blocked a punt, causing it go through the back of Baltimore\\'s end zone for a safety. In the second quarter, Addai made an 11-yard TD run. The Ravens immediately responded as WR Yamon Figurs returned a kickoff 94&#160;yards for a touchdown, yet Indianapolis continued its run with Manning completing a 57-yard TD pass to rookie WR Anthony Gonzalez. In the third quarter, the Colts put the game away with Manning finding Gonzalez again on a 40-yard TD pass for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Baltimore tried a feeble comeback as QB Kyle Boller completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Devard Darling, while QB Troy Smith got a 6-yard TD run.

At game\\'s end, he ended up with 302 touchdown passes, surpassing John Elway for 4th place on the All-Time TD passes list.\\nAnswer this question based on the article: How many yards were gained on the two longest touchdowns scored?\\nA: 151\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 50,251 people, 20,065 households, and 13,721 families residing in the county.  The population density was 90 people per square mile (35/km2). There were 22,677 housing units at an average density of 40 per square mile (15/km2). The racial makeup of the county was 74.1% Race (United States Census), 19.3% Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census), 0.7% Race (United States Census), 1.1% Race (United States Census), 0.1% Race (United States Census), 1.8% from Race (United States Census), and 3.0% from two or more races. 5.6% of the population were Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census) of any race.\\n\\nHow many percent of people were not white?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n25.9\\n\\n\\nquestion: The first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920. The Harvard Business School offered the first Master of Business Administration degree (MBA) in 1921. People like Henri Fayol (1841-1925) and Alexander Hamilton Church (1866-1936) described the various branches of management and their inter-relationships. In the early-20th century, people like Ordway Tead (1891-1973), Walter Dill Scott (1869-1955) and J. Mooney applied the principles of psychology to management. Other writers, such as Elton Mayo (1880-1949), Mary Follett (1868-1933), Chester Barnard (1886-1961), Max Weber (1864-1920), who saw what he called the \"administrator\" as bureaucrat, Rensis Likert (1903-1981), and Chris Argyris (born 1923) approached the phenomenon of management from a sociology perspective.\\nAnswer this question: Who lived longer, Henri Fayol or Ordway Tead?\\nanswer: Henri Fayol\\n\\n\\nThe Free State government had started peace negotiations in early May, which broke down. The High Court of Justice in Ireland  ruled on 31 July 1923 that a state of war no longer existed, and consequently the internment of republicans, permitted under common law only in wartime, was now illegal. Without a formal peace, holding 13,000 prisoners and worried that fighting could break out again at any time, the government enacted two Public Safety  Acts on 1 and 3 August 1923, to permit continued internment and other measures. Thousands of Anti-Treaty IRA members  were arrested by the Free State forces in the weeks and months after the end of the war, when they had dumped their arms and returned home. On 27 August 1923, a general election was held, which Cumann na nGaedheal, the pro-Free State party, won with about 40% of the first-preference vote. The Republicans, represented by Sinn Féin, won about 27% of the vote. Many of their candidates and supporters were still imprisoned before, during and after the election. In October 1923, around 8,000 of the 12,000 Republican prisoners in Free State gaols went on a hunger strike. The strike lasted for 41 days and met little success . However, most of the women prisoners were released shortly thereafter and the hunger strike helped concentrate the Republican movement on the prisoners and their associated organisations. In July, de Valera had recognised the Republican political interests lay with the prisoners and went so far as to say:\\n\\nWhich happened last, the ruling that a state of war no longer existed, or the enactment of Public Safety Acts?\\nA: Public Safety Acts\\n\\n\\nQ: Coming off their win over the Falcons, the Cowboys stayed at home for a Week 8 duel with the Seattle Seahawks.  Dallas would trail early in the first quarter as Seahawks kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 43-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys answered with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 36-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Sam Hurd.  In the second quarter, Dallas increased their lead as running back Marion Barber got a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Seahawks would reply with quarterback Matt Hasselbeck\\'s 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Deion Branch, yet the Cowboys came right back with Romo\\'s 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Roy Williams. Dallas would greatly increase their lead in the third quarter with Romo hooking up with wide receiver Miles Austin on a 3-yard touchdown pass, followed by wide receiver Patrick Crayton returning a punt 82 yards for a touchdown.  In the fourth quarter, the Cowboys solidified their win with kicker Nick Folk nailing a 40-yard field goal.  Seattle would close out the game\\'s scoring with Hasselbeck\\'s 4-yard touchdown pass to fullback Justin Griffith.

       "    'content': 'An example of a movie review. positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\n\\nA: Wow... I mean WOW this has got to be one of the best story\\'s I\\'ve ever had the chance to read/watch. We all know this famous story. Two martial artist, a man and his son, go to train in the forbidden Cursed Springs and while ignoring their warnings they both fall in a spring each. The dad, Genma, the spring of drowned Panda. And 16 year old Ranma, the spring of drowned girl. Now with every splash of cold water they turn into the very being titled to the spring they landed in. Crazy enough yet? No, thats just the beginning. As if being one of the strongest teenagers to ever exist who turns into a female wasn\\'t enough, Ranma has to deal with crazed martial arts teachers and hundreds of insane art styles, an insane high school principle, opponents right and left who have a score to settle with Ranma wither it be for messing up their life early on somehow or for \"stealling\" their loved ones. And speaking of loved ones, I\\'ve lost track of how many times a boy or a girl has fallen in love with Ranma. And not once has it been his fiancée, Akane. And thats just from the first few chapters/episodes of the series.\\n\\nThe story itself is amazing. I have never come across something so crazy, so bizarre, so... so... out of this world and yet its so down to Earth and believable... I can\\'t even describe it to its fullest. Its just a charming story thats so easy to get into. What I like about it is the humor. Not once have I laughed out loud this much from a manga, and it doesn\\'t have to try any of the stunts you would catch in Simpson\\'s or something of the sort. I could read any part of the comic and I would be laughing from beginning to end. Another thing is the characters. Ranma, you would think making him too strong would be a set back but nooo... with every little problem the story throws at him he\\'s doing his best just to survive half the time and his personality is that of a foolish young boy it would seem but when worst comes to worst he can be a calculating genius. And to think, of the hundreds of perverts in the show, Ranma who hates the idea of perverts all together is considered by everyone in his town, more so by Akane, the worst pervert to ever live. His father Genma, you would think the father character would blend in to the background right? Correct! But whenever he does have some spotlight... he just gives you more reasons to hate him yet at the same love him! You think you know the worst dad ever from an anime? You haven\\'t met Genma. Ryoga, probably one of Ranma\\'s greatest rivals and my favorite character (next to Ranma)... and probably one of the only people he can actually stand. Most likely the strongest character in the series but has two faults, one is his curse that turns him into a baby pig but his worst fault... is his lack of sense in direction! Then we have... you know, I could spend hours at the computer explaining all the characters, the story\\'s, everything positive about it but that would be just pointless.\\n\\nCheck out the series if you haven\\'t, NOW! You WILL NOT regret it! Though I would advise checking the comic out first. I like the anime, but I\\'ve had some trouble getting the series at a good price. And a small nitpick, the humor doesn\\'t seem to translate to the anime as well as the manga. I think partly because the comic seems more cartoonish to me. But either way, its a win win! 10 out of 10!\\n\\n\\nQ: What\\'s an example of a movie review?\\nAn example of a movie review is here: Scott Henderson, the engineer that employs Carol Richman, as his assistant, makes a point to call her \"Kansas\", whenever he speaks to her. It shows us that Carol, effectively played by Ella Raines, is supposed to be a babe in the woods, as far as the Manhattan of the 40s was concerned. Only a woman, from out of town, would follow the shady bartender to a solitary elevated subway. Even then, only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure.\\n\\nRobert Siodmak directed this film noir very well. He shows a flair for infusing the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days. How else could we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical, where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat, makes such an overt pass at a lady on a date? The drummer played with high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. doesn\\'t hide his desires for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays. It was a real explicit invitation, first to the \"phantom woman\" of the story, Fay Helm; afterward, Cliff the drummer, insinuates himself very openly to Ella Raines who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery dame her boss had taken originally.\\n\\nThis is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning. There are things not explained in it, but it holds the one\\'s interest throughout. The killer is not revealed until the end. \\n\\nElla Raines with her expressive eyes was an under estimated actress. She holds her own against much more experienced actors. Franchot Tone, a New York stage actor, working in Hollywood, never found in this medium the fame he deserved. He is effective as the accused man\\'s best friend. On the other hand, Alan Curtis, comes across as a man, who when framed, accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him. Thomas Gomez, as the inspector Burgess, is an asset to the film as a detective who has his doubts the police had caught the man who committed the crime.\\n\\nThis movie will not disappoint.\\n\\n\\nProblem: Write a positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) movie review.\\n\\nAnswer: Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman along with Jennifer Aniston combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season (late May) and a good improvement on Carrey\\'s past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies. With a slightly toned down Carrey antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self, Carrey powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic, tearfully somber moments. Elements of Jim\\'s real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie. This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons, including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script. While still lacking in the superbly polished ensemble of comedy/drama, Bruce, Almightly deserves credit for being a great date movie along with a solid message and soft spiritual cynicism and parody that maintains its good-natured taste. Eight out of ten stars.\\n\\n\\nProblem: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive positive\\n=++++=\\nAnswer: Being the first feature film with Robert De Niro (although not released for years later), this is worth the watch. De Niro\\'s role isn\\'t huge, yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it. Any die hard De Niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today.\\n\\n\\nAn example of a movie review. negative (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\n\\nA:'},\n",

       "    'content': \"It's not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had little potential. Indeed the under-explored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and, for at least the opening half, this Tobe Hooper effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy '90s horror can. But somewhere between Brad Dourif's on-again-off-again performance and the overly intricate plot, this would-be thriller loses its way.\\n\\nDourif, featured here before his built-in horror fan base had accumulated, is average guy Sam. Of course average guys don't stay average for long in horror movies, so after a well-done origin outline, we see Sam's various body parts start to ignite. Soon he's igniting other people, too, much to the consternation of gal pal Lisa, played unmemorably by Cynthia Bain.\\n\\nWhile the title of the film implies a fire-happy monster on the loose, director Hooper opted to make Sam an unwilling killer. This approach gives the film an added human depth it would otherwise lack, but it also prevents us from truly fearing the human flamethrower. We're left wondering whether this would have worked better as a straight-up villain-versus-everyone effort ala NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.\\n\\nSPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION is a pretty nominal effort when all is said and done. It will carry added appeal for Dourif's fans and those who can't get enough 1990s horror, be it good, bad or in between, but only on a slow night.\"}]},\n",

Remember to show your book to your primary audience: children. Read  your manuscript to kids and pay attention to whether they seem to “get it,” which parts make them bored, and so on. Consider whether your book appeals to parents, teachers and librarians. They are the ones who will be purchasing your book, so it should be interesting to them, too.

You can be a better person by rising above drama and turning the conversation to a more positive subject. A good woman will also try to stay positive in her life. Even a good woman needs to complain, but constant complaining is a sign of bigger personal issues that should be dealt with before you can think of other people. Calm and patient people are often seen as “good” because they may be a constant and positive presence during a crisis. You will be less prone to over-reaction and argument if you can be patient with others and yourself. A good woman is often seen as strong because she keeps going during emotional and physical trials. You can build emotional resilience by valuing willpower, confidence and courage. All of these qualities are seen as desirable and positive in a woman; however, no human being is constantly virtuous. Recognize that just having a few of these qualities makes you a good woman and don’t be too hard on yourself if you falter.\\nSummary:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: Article: Practicing what some doctors call \"scent therapy\" can engage new receptors in your nose, improving your sense of smell over time. Choose several strong smells that are pleasant to you and spend a few minutes every day sniffing each one. After a few weeks, your nose will be able to pick up on these smells more easily. When you start noticing a difference, practice with more smells.   Essential oils are very useful tools when it comes to scent therapy. Chose 3 or 4 oils with smells you like, such as lemongrass, cedar, vanilla and geranium rose. You can also use raw materials to conduct scent therapy. Gather a few small jars and fill each one with a different strong-smelling substance, such as ground coffee, dried basil leaves, a few drops of your favorite floral shampoo, and so on. Keep the lids on the jars when you aren\\'t using them so the smells stay strong. When you conduct scent therapy, you should sniff quickly, rather than deeply inhaling each scent. This way you\\'ll avoid scent fatigue. Another form of therapy you can try is experimenting with identifying different types of smells with your eyes closed. Practicing this over the course of a few months will enhance your ability to distinguish between different smells. Close your eyes and have someone hold different substances under your nose one at a time. See if you can identify the smells.  Start by rotating smells that are quite different, like chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon, or bourbon, orange juice and peppermint tea. As you get better at distinguishing between smells, start working with smells that are more difficult to tell apart, like strawberry, cherry and raspberry, or lemon, lime and grapefruit. When you identify and describe a smell out loud, your ability to perceive it is sharpened. Make a practice of talking about smells as you experience them. Describe them out loud using specific language, the way a wine connoisseur would talk about the characteristics of different wines. Make a point of noticing and talking about everyday smells. For example, describe the nuances of your dinner\\'s scent: \"I can smell the earthy ground corn in these tortillas, the sweet and spicy tang of the pork filling, the fresh soapy scent of the cilantro, and the floral citrus burst of the lime.\" Getting a little exercise can enhance your sense of smell. Go for a walk or jog, then pay attention to the smells around you. It\\'s possible that the extra moisture in your nose that accumulates with exercise helps sharpen your ability to smell Having a zinc deficiency can lead to a dulled sense of smell as well as taste. Take supplements or consume foods high in zinc, like lamb, grass-fed beef, scallops, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and oats. Certain medications have the side effect of dulling the sense of smell. Medication prescribed for Parkinson\\'s disease, antibiotics, and blood pressure medication can affect your sense of smell. If you\\'re on a medication that has this side effect, talk to your doctor to make sure you\\'re receiving the right dosage. A clogged sinus, whether it\\'s caused by a cold or allergies, will prevent you from being able to smell properly. A cold will go away, but if you tend to have allergies throughout the year, you might want to check into getting on medication to free up your sinuses so you can smell properly again. Smoking cigarettes is a huge culprit when it comes to dulling the senses, especially your sense of smell. If you can cut back or quit smoking your sense of smell will greatly improve. Chewing tobacco and other tobacco products have the same effect.\\nSummary: Inhale strong smells every day. Close your eyes and inhale. Describe smells out loud. Work up a sweat. Eat more zinc. Check your medication. Treat your allergies. Stop smoking.\\n\\nProblem: Article: Reverse stencils work similar to regular stencils, except that you will be putting paint around the shape instead. Here\\'s a list of what you will need:  Cardstock Craft knife Double-sided tape or repositionable spray adhesive Foam roller or paint sponges Acrylic paint or wall paint Paint pan or paint palette Paper towels You can also use template plastic, or blank stencil sheeting as well.  You can find template plastic in the quilting section of a fabric store. You can find blank stencil sheeting in the stencil section of an arts and crafts store. You can also spray the back of each shape with repositionable spray adhesive. You can create a grid or checkered pattern. You can also use a completely random pattern. If you are using shapes of different sizes, consider arranging them in an asymmetric clump. Keep the larger shapes towards the center, and the smaller shapes towards the edges/ends. Don\\'t pour out a whole lot, or the paint will dry out before you can finish using it. You can always pour more paint out into your paint pan or paint palette. If you are painting a large area, consider using wall paint. If you are painting just a small area, any acrylic paint will do.  If you are using a paint roller to apply the paint, you might find a paint pan easier to use. If you are using a small paint sponge, you might find a paint palette easier to work with. This will prevent you from applying too much paint all at once. If you apply too much paint at one time, the paint may not dry or cure properly. It may also end up with a bubbly texture. Because of this, it is much better to apply many thin coats of paint rather than one thick coat. Simply roll the foam paint roller across the entire wall, including your shapes. If you want a softer look, you can gently tap around your shapes with a paint sponge. Wait for the paint to dry, then apply a second coat. If you are taping the paint on with a sponge, you can even use a slightly lighter or darker color. If you remove the shapes after the paint dries, you will risk accidentally chipping the paint. Gently peel the shapes off using your fingernail. Look over your design, and fill in any gaps using a thin brush and some extra paint. If you got paint where you don\\'t want it to be, wipe it off using a damp Q-tip. Most acrylic paints will dry within 20 minutes to two hours. Latex wall paints have a different composition and may require four to six hours to dry, if not more. Refer to the label on the can or bottle for more specific drying times.\\nSummary:'},\n",

I\\'ve eaten here a couple of times over the years and either they\\'ve gone downhill or I remember it being a lot cheaper and a lot better.  I tried a bunch of different things and even though it was buffet I didnt think it was that fresh.  The mahi mahi was rubbery and fishy, the pasta was left out too long and started to dry up, and the desert selection seemed to be quite limited.  The Bellagio or TI buffet is much better.\\n\\n\\nQ: negative\\n\\nA: I don\\'t want to give it a star...  I work right beside emzy.. So I used to visit quite frequently (about 5 times). I have ordered Singapore hair noodles, fried rice, eg noodles. I kind of likes spicy so I tried customizing it every time I ordered( less oil and spicy) but they used to miss it every time.   But I will focus mostly on my last visit to this place.   I ordered angel hair Singaporean noodle less oil and spicy( which was never made) so i don\\'t want to compromise this time unlike last 4 times and I went back complaining... Receptionist made me wait for 5 mins( was ok waiting) then the manager came to me took the noodles from me went in and came back with my order in approx a min and all this time they did not even apologized or had any concern about the customer.. I went back to ofc opened the Togo.. I just had one spoon and almost tears ran through my eyes( I am indian I can handle spicy) but this item which was modified in a minute was can\\'t b ehandled by any human( he added sambal and chilli powder I guess and returned my order). I was so pissed and went back to the manager complaining about it. He is so ridiculously stupid and instead of satisfying the customer he told me that \"that\\'s how we make food\"   What a jerk.

Quite frankly, I don\\'t understand the reason behind some of the negative reviews.  Hooters is not a luxury hotel and does not pretend to be either.  Hooters is located just off the strip, across the street from the MGM.    First, it was inexpensive.  Second, the rooms were clean and large.  And finally , it had everything you could expect in a hotel- multiple swimming pools, multiple restaurants, parking, cable tv and good water pressure.  Hooters is a short walk from the action of the strip.  Las Vegas is a great tourist destination which you can\\'t experience from a hotel room.  Therefore, Hooters is a great place to sleep, shower and change before you head out for your Las Vegas adventure.  Now, if the place were a dump or if you were expecting luxury then maybe you would  be disappointed.

       "    'content': \"City and Federal Officials to Manage Jamaica Bay\\n\\nMylan Cannon/The New York Times\\n\\nThe city and the National Park Service will work together to plan restoration projects for over 10,000 acres of parkland.\\n\\nNew York City and the National Park Service formalized a partnership on Tuesday to jointly manage more than 10,000 acres of parkland in and around Jamaica Bay, which stretches across south Brooklyn to Queens.\\n\\nUnder the agreement, city and federal officials will for the first time work together to improve access, foster research, run education and recreation programs and plan restoration projects for the bay, which is an important estuary and a migratory stopover for hundreds of species of birds. The move followed an announcement last fall that sketched out the vision for such a partnership.\\n\\n“The United States and New York City have joined forces to establish a single seamless park that is readily accessible to New Yorkers,” said Ken Salazar, the interior secretary, who, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, signed the agreement at a news conference at City Hall.\\n\\nJamaica Bay is an unusual patchwork of private, city, state and federal lands. City parks in the bay area total 3,300 acres and include Canarsie, Idlewild, Marine, Paerdegat Basin and Spring Creek Parks, as well as Rockaway Beach. The federal holdings, which span 7,300 acres, include Floyd Bennett Field, Fort Tilden, Jacob Riis Park, Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge and a smattering of salt-marsh islands, all making up part of the Gateway National Recreation Area.\\n\\nThe announcement came after years of efforts, sometimes sputtering, by environmental advocates, city officials and nonprofit groups to protect the bay. Intensive development, industry, sewage treatment plants and Kennedy International Airport have all hampered water quality and caused erosion. But last year, the Natural Resources Defense Council signed an agreement with state and city officials that would cut in half the amount of nitrogen discharged into the bay from four treatment plants, improving the health of the bay.\\n\\nThe new partnership also calls for the creation of a conservancy or friends group dedicated to the bay, to encourage philanthropy. Similar conservancies have helped other large parks in New York City, including Central Park in Manhattan and Prospect Park in Brooklyn, find new streams of revenue, but they tend to be in affluent neighborhoods. Given that the bay is ringed by largely working- and middle-class communities, however, it is uncertain how successful that effort will be.\\n\\nMr. Bloomberg said he had appointed a task force to make recommendations for the friends group, and named Thomas F. Secunda, one of the founders of Bloomberg L.P., as its chairman. The fund-raising group will most likely be modeled on the Park Service’s most successful friends group, at Golden Gate National Recreation Area in San Francisco.\\n\\nIn addition, the partners will invite proposals from academic and science-based institutions for a new research program — and potentially a new science center — that will focus on the bay’s restoration. The Park Service and the mayor’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability released a “request for expressions of interest” on Tuesday; responses are due in early November. The Rockefeller Foundation also committed $1.5 million to establish such a center, which would study the resilience of coastal environments in the face of climate change. Last fall, the foundation pledged $250,000 to develop a Jamaica Bay parks master plan.\\n\\n“This historic partnership,” Mr. Bloomberg said, “will improve our city’s great natural treasure — Jamaica Bay — by creating restored, resilient natural landscapes, more outdoor recreation, new and cutting-edge research collaborations, and an improved, sustainable transportation framework.\\n\\n“This is an important example of the great things that can happen when different levels of government work together.”\\n\\nSummary: New York City and the National Park Service will work together to improve access and plan restoration projects for more than 10,000 acres of parkland.\\n\\n\\nSchool stabbing suspect allegedly triggers bomb scare at hospital\\n\\nA bomb scare Friday night at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood was due to a threat made by a man who had been arrested on suspicion of stabbing his estranged 17-year-old girlfriend to death at South East High School in South Gate earlier that morning, sheriff's officials said.\\n\\nThe suspect, Abraham Lopez, 18, a senior at the school, claimed during questioning by detectives that he had placed explosives at various locations, including the parking structure of the hospital where the girl was taken after the attack, according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department report.\\n\\nAn arson and explosives team was sent to the locations he identified, including the hospital parking structure, and found no suspicious devices, according to the report.\\n\\nCoroner’s officials have not released the name of the girl who died. Lopez has been charged with murder in her death.\\n\\nThe attack occurred shortly before 11 a.m. as lunchtime was beginning at the high school at 2720 Tweedy Blvd.\\n\\nAccording to the report, Lopez began hitting the girl, then fell on top of her and began stabbing her. A student, a school dean and school police officer stepped in to stop the attack. The student and dean were cut and the police officer suffered an injured back, authorities said. All were treated at area hospitals.\\n\\nGirl fatally stabbed at South Gate high school\\n\\nPhotos: Stabbing at South Gate high school\\n\\nFootball player who broke up high school stabbing identified\\n\\nPhoto: Los Angeles School Police look at photos from surveillance cameras after a stabbing on the campus of South East High School.

Britain and France believed that war could still be avoided, and that the Soviet Union, weakened by the Great Purge, could not be a main military participant, a point that many military sources were at variance with, especially Soviet victories over the Japanese Kwantung army on the Manchurian frontier. France was more anxious to find an agreement with the USSR than was Britain; as a continental power, it was more willing to make concessions, more fearful of the dangers of an agreement between the USSR and Germany. These contrasting attitudes partly explain why the USSR has often been charged with playing a double game in 1939: carrying on open negotiations for an alliance with Britain and France while secretly considering propositions from Germany.\\nTry to answer this question if possible: Why did western power believe that the soviet government wouldn’t partake in another world war?\\nAnswer: Great Purge\\nQuestion: Dominic became the spiritual father to several Albigensian women he had reconciled to the faith, and in 1206 he established them in a convent in Prouille.

The monastery was at Prouille would later become Dominic\\'s headquarters for his missionary effort there. After two years on the mission field, Prior Diego died while traveling back to Spain.

The church was established with the assistance of the New Light evangelist Henry Alline. Many of Alline\\'s followers, after his death, would convert and strengthen the Baptist presence in the Atlantic region.[page needed] Two major groups of Baptists formed the basis of the churches in the Maritimes.

A member of the Republican Party, Royce became the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs in 2013. He was re-elected to his seat in 2016, having spent over $3.5 million on his campaign.

He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \"the ways of Foggy Bottom\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947.  During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan.  While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan.  In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon\\'s rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong\\'s communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\" \"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\" \"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%.\\n\\nAnswer this question \"Was he involved with politics?\"\\noutput:'},\n",

Not only was the film-maker delighted to see Wilko Johnson defy death, he also thinks he ended up with a better film.  And it\\'s not just for fans of rock\\'n\\'roll, he says.\\nIn late 2013, Temple was approached to work with Johnson.  The guitarist had already appeared in Oil City Confidential, Temple\\'s 2009 film featuring 1970s R&B band Dr Feelgood and their home territory of Canvey Island in Essex.\\n\"But this time it looked like quite a small project,\" Temple says.  \"Wilko was making an album with [The Who\\'s] Roger Daltrey on a very quick turnaround, and they needed a video.  But Wilko is an engaging man, and I thought I would at least film a couple of conversations with him.  Because by then he certainly had a story to tell.\"\\nThe outline of that story is now well known.  The guitarist had largely slipped from the headlines until, in early 2013, he gave a candid interview to BBC Radio 4\\'s Front Row programme, explaining he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and been told he had about 10 months to live.\\nIn the interview, Johnson, now 67, was resolute and humorous.  He impressed listeners with his determination to make the best of whatever time was left to him.\\nWhich, as Temple\\'s film records, has turned out to be considerably longer than doctors expected.\\nThis week, The Ecstasy of Wilko Johnson received its UK premiere, in London, in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust charity.  Afterwards, Johnson played a celebratory set at the 100 Club on Oxford Street.\\nAptly, photographs were being taken by surgeon Charlie Chan.  Chan works in Cheltenham and specialises in breast surgery, but his other passion is photography.  The combination has had an extraordinary effect on Johnson\\'s life and may even have saved it.\\nChan says he was taken aback when he went to photograph the guitarist at the London venue Koko in October 2013.  \"I\\'d already photographed Wilko at home in Southend that summer - which I was certain would be the last time I would ever see him,\" he says. \"Yet he actually looked better at the club than he had three months before.\\n\"I\\'m not a specialist in pancreatic cancers, but the penny dropped.  Something just didn\\'t add up: by then he should have been very sick indeed or probably dead.  So I arranged for Wilko to see the surgeon Emmanuel Huguet at Addenbrooke\\'s hospital in Cambridge.  After that things moved very quickly.\"\\nJulien Temple did not set out to make a standard hospital documentary, but the parts of The Ecstasy that record Wilko Johnson\\'s medical journey are gripping and at times moving.\\nYet the director says he hopes audiences will be equally engaged by the sight of Johnson by the River Thames in Essex, playing chess with the sinister figure of Death.\\nAt the time, no-one expected Johnson could possibly take the game.\\nThe chess is an obvious nod to Ingmar Bergman\\'s film The Seventh Seal.   It is not the only movie classic Temple borrows from.\\n\"These days a documentary like this is made with a crew of four or five, but modern kit can serve the film-maker incredibly well,\" he says. \"We could retain the intimacy which was important to let Wilko speak openly.  But we also weave in several dramatic clips from Powell and Pressburger\\'s classic film A Matter of Life and Death from 1946.\"\\nIn the film, David Niven plays a wartime RAF pilot who cheats death: Temple says the parallel seemed irresistible.  Johnson grins and says it is one of his favourite films too.\\nThe documentary is not all about death or defeating death.  We also learn why Johnson loves astronomy and Canvey Island so much.  The soundtrack features everything from 1950s rock\\'n\\'roll to Ralph Vaughan Williams.\\nJohnson says the time under a sentence of death now feels like a dream he is in the process of shaking off.   \"I\\'ve been told that Julien captures that well, but the truth is so far I\\'ve avoided seeing the complete film: I find it toe-curling to watch myself on screen or to read pieces about my life,\" he says.\\n\"Who knows what the future will bring, but Charlie Chan and then the NHS at Addenbrooke\\'s gave me a new lease of life.  It was hard originally to get my head around the terrible diagnosis two and a half years ago.  But in a way to be told by Mr Huguet in Cambridge that my cancer was operable after all was even more difficult to take in.  I\\'ve been incredibly lucky.\"\\nTemple says no project he has ever worked on has changed so much so quickly.  \"It was about two months between my coming on board and then suddenly Wilko getting his amazing news,\" her says. \"My mum was dying at the time that Wilko was so ill, and all the emotions began to merge.  I actually found what Wilko said, both on screen and off, very inspiring.\\n\"I love the music in the film, seeing Wilko perform now and 40 years ago.  But the film is not just for fans of rock\\'n\\'roll.  All of us are going to face something like he faced - either ourselves or in a parent or a partner or a friend.\\n\"Both of us are atheists, but I think there\\'s an unexpected element of spirituality to the film.  That is as well as the rock\\'n\\'roll of course.\"\\nThe Ecstasy of Wilko Johnson is in selected cinemas from 17 July\\nsummary: What do you do if you set out to make an intimate documentary about a terminally ill rock performer - only to discover your central character then makes an astonishing return to health?\\nText: The three-part drama tells the story of young architect Ellen, who feels increasingly undermined by the woman who is to cover her maternity leave.\\nThe programme is set in Glasgow and uses the city\\'s most stylish buildings as locations.\\nThe fictional firm at the heart of the drama, Gillies Warnock Architects, operates from a glass-fronted studio in the Merchant City.\\nAnd the home of the firm\\'s bosses is a spectacular wood and glass-fronted house which features in several scenes.\\nIt is an ex-furniture restorers\\' workshop in Glasgow city centre that was converted into a spacious, light-filled home.\\nProf Dunlop, whose practice was responsible for a number of buildings in Edinburgh, and Glasgow including the Radisson Hotel on Argyle Street, told BBC Scotland that writer and director Joe Ahearne had put his finger on many of the real issues facing architects in practice such as staff relationships, egos, authorship, credit and accountability.\\nHe thinks the main character, Ellen, is a believable young architect but has some reservations about the studio set-up and its relationship with its client.\\nHowever, Prof Dunlop said: \"Without doubt the real star of The Replacement is Glasgow, the city looks splendid, with action in many of its Georgian and Victorian masterpieces, including the Hutcheson\\'s Hall by Scottish architect David Hamilton and the City Chambers.\\n\"The Merchant City, West End tenements and residences feature prominently.

In 2009, the American Anthropological Association\\'s Commission on the Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Communities released its final report concluding, in part, that, \"When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology.

I was just happy to be in Vegas so I maintained a pleasant attitude. The clerk was pleasant--I will give him that. I had a Visa Debit Card thru Bank of America. Because it was a debit card--even though every other place I\\'ve been treats it as a Visa Card  Payless was going to put a $350 hold on rather then the standaRD $200.  Well--okay I guess. Well next because its a Visa Debit Card they must do a credit check. HUH????   WHY?  Once you run my card if I have the money it will be approved.  I knew this wasn\\'t going to end well for me---so now I am frustrated. I failed the Credit Check--and honestly I had enough money in that account to buy whatever car they were going to rent me. The agent kindly told me to head to EZ Car and they will match my quote. Dang it--why didn\\'t I just do that---with no credit check and they treat the Visa Debit as everyone else does with a $200 hold.  EZ Car---wonderful--In and out in 11 minutes with my car and a rate 2 bucks cheaper then Payless.   STAY AWAY!!\\n\\n\\nQ: positive\\n\\nA: i read the previous reviews. and they were very helpful. and the chinese sausage fried rice was very good. when youre in vegas everything is expensive. i went here recently after christmas and wanted asian food. this is conveniently in the venetian where we were staying, so tried it out.  -bf had the wonton noodle soup-was actually really good. -i had their chinese sausage fried rice- delicious -appetizer- -tried friend\\'s spicy wonton appetizer.- really good as well. Friends: had schezuan spicy noodle thing, they said it was good. We ate here for lunch. and by 5pm i was here again for early dinner and ordered what my bf had for lunch (haha), and by 8pm we were at the wynn buffet waiting in line.

Then some guy came in talking business with the counter guy (I think he\\'s the owner) and I got to listen to the owner complain about his margins... Really, I just paid $11.50 for a bland sandwich and now you\\'re bitching about your profit margin while I eat it, washed down with a canned soda?

Sure, a bit pricey but let\\'s remember where we are.  My boyfriend and I shared the Ultimate Steak & Eggs Sliders and a mixed greens salad.  Wow! The sliders really blew me away!!!  I know - sliders! The Bacon-Cheddar Muffin was to die for, the filet mignon was oh-so-tender and tasty and the egg and creamed spinach were the perfect finishing touch.  The fries were tasty as well and my boyfriend definitely loved the mini ketchup bottle.  This was all so good we returned twice during our stay for breakfast.  I love it that they have a good selection of Bloody Marys and that the girl actually mixes them tableside and customizes them for you! The Society with blue cheese stuffed olives is a must!  Their Frosted Flake French Toast was excellent and the Chocolate cream definitely serves to balance out the sweetness of the bananas.

These are often large buildings, purpose-built to provide ventilation and low light intensities (this reduces the birds\\' activity and thereby increases the rate of weight gain). The lights can be switched on for 24-hrs/day, or a range of step-wise light regimens to encourage the birds to feed often and therefore grow rapidly. Females achieve slaughter weight at about 15 weeks of age and males at about 19. Mature commercial birds may be twice as heavy as their wild counterparts. Many different breeds have been developed, but the majority of commercial birds are white, as this improves the appearance of the dressed carcass, the pin feathers being less visible.

The rudimentary \"mechanical man\" simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen\\'s book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a \"big prize\" if they were successful. While his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could \"speak\", albeit only a few words. The boys would carefully adjust the \"lips\" and when a bellows forced air through the windpipe, a very recognizable \"Mama\" ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.\\nWho created the automaton Bell saw?\\nA: Sir Charles Wheatstone\\n\\nContext and question: The standard PlayStation 3 version of the XrossMediaBar (pronounced Cross Media Bar, or abbreviated XMB) includes nine categories of options.

It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness. My problem is that it was not made in this realm, but by a human, and only a human may handle it. The herb vendor will tell you where you can find it. If you would fetch me this stone, I would tell you what I can.\" \"Of course we will fetch you the stone,\" Nepthys assured him. \"You have our thanks.\" Outside, the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone. He told Nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street, and we set off. When we reached the street, I expected some sort of temple, or a row of antiquaries, or at least a sleazy, black-market relics merchant. Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys. Nepthys didn\\'t need to warn me not to speak to them. He took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under G d\\'s light, and handcuffed. Inside, the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions. Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive. A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to us. \"Good evening, gentlemen,\" she said. \"May I invite you to have a cup of tea?\" \"No, thank you,\" said Nepthys, \"we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer. Are you the proprietor of this shop?\" \"Yes,\" answered the woman. \"I am Madame Entera, at your service. \\n\\nWho can handle the stone?\\n\\n\\nThelma James was a prime candidate for a real estate ripoff: She is 68, has precious little money and can\\'t read or write. \"I won\\'t lie to you. I was so-o-o excited,\" the widow and former duplex dweller said of the purchase of her first home, a sagging frame structure on Snowden. \"I was glad to get me a house.\" When James realized she had been swindled she turned to Memphis Area Legal Services, which represented her in a lawsuit. Now, James\\'s monthly house notes have dropped from $796 - more than twice her monthly income - to an affordable $247. Some of the people who took advantage of her through a questionable loan program were sent to jail. \"I don\\'t know what I would have done without Legal Services,\" said James. \"They solved a lot of my problems.\" James is one of more than 3,000 clients served last year by MALS, which provides assistance for civil matters, such as domestic abuse and family-related problems, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, veterans, housing and consumer fraud cases. Like James, most clients are elderly or female. Some are handicapped. Some need medical care or veteran\\'s benefits. Some are trying to escape eviction or an abusive marriage. And 87 percent live at or below poverty level. Shelby County Mayor A C Wharton recently said Legal Services is important for those who, because of poverty or other struggles in life, think justice is an empty word. \"They must be given reason to believe that the law is for them too,\" said Wharton, a former executive director of MALS. But MALS faces a funding crunch next year, brought on by a $200,000 shortfall from three revenue sources. \\n\\nWho solved a lot of Thelma James problems?\\n\\n\\n We drove about a great deal--the country at the back of Deauville, going away from the sea, is lovely--very like England--charming narrow roads with high banks and hedges on each side--big trees with spreading branches meeting overhead--stretches of green fields with cows grazing placidly and horses and colts gambolling about.  It is a great grazing and breeding country.  There are many haras (breeding stables) in the neighbourhood, and the big Norman posters are much in demand.  I have friends who never take their horses to the country.  They hire for the season a pair of strong Norman horses that go all day up and down hill at the same regular pace and who get over a vast amount of country.

Concerns were raised that secure boot could prevent or hinder the use of alternate operating systems such as Linux. In a post discussing secure boot on the Building Windows 8 blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that \"At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC. Microsoft\\'s philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves.\" Microsoft\\'s certification guidelines for Windows 8 ultimately revealed that vendors would be required to provide means for users to re-configure or disable secure boot in their device\\'s UEFI firmware. It also revealed that ARM devices (Windows RT) would be required to have secure boot permanently enabled, with no way for users to disable it. However, Tom Warren of The Verge noted that other vendors have implemented similar hardware restrictions on their own ARM-based tablet and smartphone products (including those running Microsoft\\'s own Windows Phone platform), but still argued that Microsoft should \"keep a consistent approach across ARM and x86, though, not least because of the number of users who\\'d love to run Android alongside Windows 8 on their future tablets.\" No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs.\\nWhat ideology does Microsoft follow?\\n\\nANS: to provide customers with the best experience first, and allow them to make decisions themselves\\n\\nQUES: Beyoncé attended St. Mary\\'s Elementary School in Fredericksburg, Texas, where she enrolled in dance classes.

The Native American tribes were excluded from the settlement; a subsequent conflict, known as Pontiac\\'s War, was also unsuccessful in returning them to their pre-war status. In Europe, the war began disastrously for Prussia, but a combination of good luck and successful strategy saw King Frederick the Great manage to retrieve the Prussian position and retain the status quo ante bellum. Prussia emerged as a new European great power. Although Austria failed to retrieve the territory of Silesia from Prussia (its original goal) its military prowess was also noted by the other powers. The involvement of Portugal, Spain and Sweden did not return them to their former status as great powers. France was deprived of many of its colonies and had saddled itself with heavy war debts that its inefficient financial system could barely handle. Spain lost Florida but gained French Louisiana and regained control of its colonies, e.g., Cuba and the Philippines, which had been captured by the British during the war. France and other European powers avenged their defeat in 1778 when the American Revolutionary War broke out, with hopes of destroying Britain\\'s dominance once and for all.\\nWhat did Great Britain gain in the West Indies from the war?\\n\\nANS: some individual Caribbean islands in the West Indies,\\n\\nQUES: Northwestern fields 19 intercollegiate athletic teams (8 men\\'s and 11 women\\'s) in addition to numerous club sports.

With a loss by the Chiefs earlier in the day, the Raiders looked to move within one game of the division lead. The Patriots quickly shut out any hope of a win, scoring touchdowns on two of their first three possessions to take a 14-0 lead. With under two minutes remaining in the half, the Raiders drove inside the New England 20 yard line in an attempt to cut the lead in half. Derek Carr hit Seth Roberts at the New England three, but Roberts did not properly secure the ball and fumbled, turning the ball over to Tom Brady and the Patriots with 33 seconds remaining in the half. New England quickly moved to the Raider 45 and Stephen Gostkowski connected on a 62-yard field goal as the half ended to move the lead to 17-0. In the second half, things got even worse for the Raiders as the Patriots scored on their third play, a Brady 64-yard pass to Brandin Cooks to extend the lead to 24 and end any hope of a Raider win. Two more Gostkowski field goals in the third quarter moved the lead to 30-0 entering the fourth quarter. Carr did hit Amari Cooper from nine yards out and converted the two-point play early in the fourth quarter. Another Gostkowski field goal ended the scoring as the Patriots dismantled the Raiders 33-8.

Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, Shearer and the other cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode. On May 13, 2015, Shearer announced he was leaving the show. After the other voice actors signed a contract for the same pay, Shearer refused, stating it was not enough. Al Jean made a statement from the producers saying \"the show must go on,\" but did not elaborate on what might happen to the characters Shearer voiced. On July 7, 2015, Shearer agreed to continue with the show, on the same terms as the other voice actors.\\n\\nHow many more dollars was Shearer\\'s salary per episode in 2003 than it was in 1997?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n95000\\n\\n\\nquestion: Still looking for their first win of the season, the Panthers flew to Cowboys Stadium for a Week 3 Monday night duel with the Dallas Cowboys.  After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina would get the lead in the second quarter with quarterback Jake Delhomme\\'s 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dante Rosario.  The Cowboys would take the lead in the third quarter with kicker Nick Folk\\'s 24-yard field goal and running back Tashard Choice\\'s 5-yard touchdown run.  Dallas would get a further grasp on the lead in the fourth quarter with Folk\\'s 19-yard field goal and cornerback Terence Newman returning Delhomme\\'s 7th interception of the season 27 yards for a touchdown (with Choice getting the 2-point conversion run).  The Panthers tried to rally, but the Cowboys\\' defense would prevent their comeback from happening.\\nAnswer this question: How long were each of Nick Folk\\'s field goals?\\nanswer: 24-yard\\n\\n\\nComing off their home win over the Vikings, the Bears flew to Sun Life Stadium for a Week 11 interconference duel with the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night.  Chicago delivered the game\\'s opening strike in the first quarter with a 46-yard field goal from kicker Robbie Gould.  The Bears added onto their lead in the second quarter with Gould\\'s 24-yard field goal. Chicago went back to work in the third quarter as Gould booted a 50-yard field goal, followed by a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Matt Fort&#233;.  As they had done all game, the Bears defense continued to stifle any offensive production by the Dolphins, thus completing the shutout, the first shutout recorded by the Bears since 2006. As of 2016, this remains the final shutout by the team. With the win, not only did the Bears improve to 7-3, but they also won their 700th game in franchise history (the first NFL team to do so). Ironically, 25 years prior, the Bears lost to the Dolphins, with the score of the 2010 matchup being the record the 1985 team was vying for had they been able to defeat the Dolphins.\\n\\nHow many yards was the longest field goal?\\nA: 50\\n\\n\\nQ: At this time Malaya, which included what is now Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, had the largest Overseas Chinese population outside of China itself.  Many of them were rich and carried out activities for the revolutionaries.  On November 13, 1910, Sun Yat-sen, along with several leading figures of the Tongmenghui, gathered at the Penang conference to draw up plans for a decisive battle. The following day on November 14, 1910, Sun Yat-sen chaired an Emergency Meeting of the Tongmenghui at 120 Armenian Street  and raised Straits Dollars $8,000 on the spot. The planning events are known as the 1910 Penang Conference.  Originally planned to occur on April 13, 1911, the preparations on April 8 did not go as planned, delaying the date to April 27. Huang Xing and nearly a hundred fellow revolutionaries forced their way into the residence of the Qing viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The uprising was initially successful but Qing reinforcements turned the battle into a catastrophic defeat. Most revolutionaries were killed, only few managed to escape. Huang Xing was wounded during the battle; he lost one of his fingers when it was hit by a bullet. Only 86 bodies were found , and the bodies of others could never be found. The dead were mostly youths with all kinds of social backgrounds, former students, teachers, journalists, and oversea Chinese.  Some of them were of high rank in the Alliance. Before the battle, most of the revolutionaries knew that the battle would probably be lost, since they were heavily outnumbered, but they went into battle anyway.  The mission was carried out like that of a suicide squad.  Their letters to their loved ones were later found.\\nHow many provinces did the Qing viceroy rule?\\n\\nA:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: In the Old Testament, camels made for a very useful literary device. Primarily, they represent great wealth; When Abraham journeys to Egypt, the Pharaoh offers him a huge bounty, including sheep, servants and -- the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me -- camels, in exchange for Abraham\\'s wife, Sarah (though in fairness, the Pharaoh thought they were siblings). Camels are used later to demonstrate Abraham\\'s own riches (acquired later in life), and ultimately, the good heart of his future daughter-in-law, Rebecca, who is chosen after she kindly offers the beasts of burden some water. Though these animals play a central role in Genesis, new evidence has called into question their existence in Israel during the lifespans of Abraham and his immediate descendents (believed to be between 2000-1500 BC), and with it, the authorship of the bible. Professors Erez Ben-Yosef and Lidar Sapir-Hen, archaeologists from Tel Aviv University in Israel, recently published a study after radiocarbon dating camel bones uncovered during excavations in the Aravah Valley -- an area on the border of Israel and the Arabian Peninsula, and one of the most logical spots where camels would have first been introduced into the country. Excavations uncovered the oldest camel bones yet found in Israel, and these dated no earlier than 940 BC -- at least 500 years later than when they are described in the bible. Read more: Inside the tomb of an ancient Egyptian brewer. \"This is a very good example that the stories were written at a much later time than they supposedly took place. The editor of these stories knew the camel was a draft animal used in his time for traveling across the desert, so of course Abraham, Jacob and David used camels. We call it an anachronism; he projected the reality that he knew at his own time,\" says Ben-Yosef. He is also quick to point out that though the stories may have been written later, his findings do not necessarily cast doubt on the tales themselves. \"It doesn\\'t necessarily mean the stories are fiction or that there is no grain of truth in them. It doesn\\'t mean Abraham wasn\\'t a real figure; he can still be a real figure. It just means that the guy who put them into written form gave the background according to his realities. There were no archaeologists back then to tell the author that camels were not around.\" Read more: The fight to save Bahrain\\'s 4,000-year-old burial mounds. The findings are not exactly new -- archaeologists have been doubting the feasibility of Abraham riding a camel into Egypt since the 1950s -- but according to Ben-Yosef, the use of radiocarbon dating of the bones does narrow down the window of possibility considerably. Naturally, not all are in agreement with the study\\'s conclusions. Alan Millard, a professor of Hebrew and ancient Semitic languages at the University of Liverpool says that while he doesn\\'t doubt the radiocarbon dating, he doesn\\'t believe it disproves that camels existed in the Patriarchal Age. \"The archaeologists were working in a valley south of the Red Sea, but the stories place Abraham in South Iraq in Ur and in Southern Turkey in the area of Harran before coming to Canaan. The fact that there were no camel bones from before 1000 BC in the south of the land doesn\\'t mean there were no camels anywhere else,\" he says. Read more: Mysterious structure found at bottom of ancient lake. \"It\\'s always dangerous to make a widespread statement on the basis of a small piece of evidence,\" he adds. Millard says that though rare, there is evidence that camels were used domestically during that period, including a Babylonian seal from between 1800 and 1700 BC carved in the style of Syria that depicts two deities sitting on a camel. Despite the biblical debate the study has kicked off, Ben-Yosef and Sapir-Hen say the primary focus of the research was not to question Genesis, but shed some light on the economic workings of the time. \"The introduction of domestic camels enabled long journeys in the Levant, and all the way to India. It represented profound socio-economic change,\" says Sapir Hen. \"Before then, they used donkeys, and they can\\'t travel those long distances without water. It really opened up trade to the rest of the world.\"\\n\\nWhat are highlight points?\\nAnswer: A new study dating the remains of camel bones has spurred a debate on the bible\\'s authorship. Several stories in the bible depict camels being used for long journeys. Archeologists from Tel Aviv University say camels weren\\'t domesticated until centuries after the biblical references.\\n\\nProblem: By. Jill Reilly. PUBLISHED:. 03:42 EST, 19 April 2012. |. UPDATED:. 04:16 EST, 19 April 2012. Tragic: 16-year-old Austin Sprout died last December. A couple who face charges for allegedly praying for their son\\'s recovery instead of seeking medical attention for his illness, have been told their six other children are now wards of the state. Brandi and Russel Bellew face second-degree manslaughter charges in the death of 16-year-old Austin Sprout last December. Prosecutors said he had been ill at home for more than a week, before dying at the family home in Oregon. But they may continue to care for their remaining children under a state-supervised \\'in-home safety plan,\\' Lane County Circuit Juvenile Court Judge Eveleen Henry also ruled in a brief afternoon hearing on Monday according to The Register Guard. It means the couple can still see the children, who are aged from a baby to 17, in their home, but a state \\'safety provider\\' must be present at all times during visits. Scroll down for video. Accused: Brandi and Russel Bellew face second-degree manslaughter charges for his death. Treatable: Prosecutors said Austin had been ill for more than a week, before dying at the family home, pictured. The Bellews are forbidden contact with each other. under terms of their pre-trial release from jail, so they will see the children separately. Another. term is that if any of the children do become ill, there must be an. immediate notification to the Department of Human Services. Both. Bellews were widows, so the children were all born in their previous relationships, except the sixth child who was born once they married. Brandi\\'s first husband, Brian Sprout, died of sepsis in 2007 after failing to seek medical treatment for a leg injury, a Lane County Sheriff’s Office lieutenant said when the Bellews were arrested in February. Athletic: Austin was a keen sportsman and played in several teams for his high school. He was the biological father of three of the six children placed in state custody Monday, as well as of Austin Sprout. Austin. Sprout\\'s uncle, Shawn Sprout told KVAL that the family is part of the. General Assembly Church of the First Born in Pleasant Hill. He said the church believes in prayer and healing. \\'We trust in God for everything. We trusted him to take care of our illnesses and heal us,\\' Shawn Sprout said. Faith: Austin Sprout\\'s uncle, Shawn Sprout said that the family is part of the General Assembly Church of the First Born in Pleasant Hill, pictured. Shawn Sprout said Austin\\'s parents gave. their son the option to seek medical care when he was became ill, but that it. was the teen\\'s choice not to see and a doctor and receive potentially life-saving treatment. In his obituary Austin was said to have loved playing basketball and hunting. At the hearing on Monday, the room was packed with relatives and supporters the Bellews.

       "    'content': 'Question: Keane was born into a working class family in Ballinderry Park, Mayfield, Cork. His father, Maurice, took work wherever he could find, which led to jobs at a local knitwear company and at Murphy\\'s Irish Stout brewery, among others. His family were keen on sport, football especially, and many of his relatives had played for junior clubs in Cork, including Rockmount. Keane took up boxing at the age of nine and trained for a number of years, winning all of his four bouts in the novice league.\\n\\nKeane made headlines again in the 2001 Manchester derby, when five minutes from the final whistle, he was sent off for a blatant knee-high foul on Alf-Inge Haland in what was seen by many as an act of revenge. He initially received a three-match suspension and a PS5,000 fine from The Football Association (FA), but further punishment was to follow after the release of Keane\\'s autobiography in August 2002, in which he stated that he intended \"to hurt\" Haland. Keane\\'s account of the incident was as follows:  I\\'d waited long enough. I fucking hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you cunt. And don\\'t ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.  An admission that the tackle was in fact a premeditated assault, it left the FA with no choice but to charge Keane with bringing the game into disrepute. He was banned for a further five matches and fined PS150,000 in the ensuing investigation. Despite widespread condemnation, he later maintained in an interview that he had no regrets about the incident: \"My attitude was, fuck him. What goes around comes around. He got his just rewards. He fucked me over and my attitude is an eye for an eye\", and said he would probably do the same thing again.  Haland later implied that the tackle effectively finished his playing career as he never played a full game afterwards. However, Haland did complete the match and played 68 minutes of the following game. He also played a friendly for Norway in between both matches. It was, in fact, a long-standing injury to his left knee that ended his career rather than his right.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What year did this occur?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer: in the 2001 Manchester derby,\\nProblem: Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the \\'80s\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut\\n\\nAfter releasing four albums in barely four years, the group went into hiatus, and nearly three years passed before their next release, although Frantz and Weymouth continued to record with the Tom Tom Club. In the meantime, Talking Heads released a live album The Name of This Band Is Talking Heads, toured the United States and Europe as an eight-piece group, and parted ways with Eno, who went on to produce albums with U2.  1983 saw the release of Speaking in Tongues, a commercial breakthrough that produced the band\\'s only American Top 10 hit, \"Burning Down the House\". Once again, a striking video was inescapable owing to its heavy rotation on MTV. The following tour was documented in Jonathan Demme\\'s Stop Making Sense, which generated another live album of the same name. The tour in support of Speaking in Tongues was their last.  Three more albums followed: 1985\\'s Little Creatures (which featured the hit singles \"And She Was\" and \"Road to Nowhere\"), 1986\\'s True Stories (Talking Heads covering all the soundtrack songs of Byrne\\'s musical comedy film, in which the band also appeared), and 1988\\'s Naked. Little Creatures offered a much more American pop-rock sound as opposed to previous efforts. Similar in genre, True Stories hatched one of the group\\'s most successful hits, \"Wild Wild Life\", and the accordion-driven track \"Radio Head\", which became the etymon of the band of the same name. Naked explored politics, sex, and death, and showed heavy African influence with polyrhythmic styles like those seen on Remain in Light. During that time, the group was falling increasingly under David Byrne\\'s control and, after Naked, the band went on \"hiatus\".  It took until December 1991 for an official announcement to be made that Talking Heads had broken up. Their final release was \"Sax and Violins\", an original song that had appeared earlier that year on the soundtrack to Wim Wenders\\' Until the End of the World. During this breakup period, Byrne continued his solo career, releasing Rei Momo in 1989 and The Forest in 1991. This period also saw a revived flourish from both Tom Tom Club (Boom Boom Chi Boom Boom and Dark Sneak Love Action) and Harrison (Casual Gods and Walk on Water), who toured together in the summer of 1990.\\n\\nWhat was the height of their success?\\n\\nAnswer with quotes:'},\n",

During the 1840s and 1850s, conflicts between the two sides became progressively more violent. After the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 (who southerners thought would work to end slavery) states in the South seceded from the United States, beginning with South Carolina in late 1860. On April 12, 1861, forces of the South (known as the Confederate States of America or simply the Confederacy) opened fire on Fort Sumter, whose garrison was loyal to the Union.\\n\\nNow answer this question: When did Confederate forces bombard Fort Sumter?\\n\\nOutput: April 12, 1861\\nArticle: The reasons for the strong Swedish dominance are as explained by Richard Sparks manifold; suffice to say here that there is a long-standing tradition, an unsusually large proportion of the populations (5% is often cited) regularly sing in choirs, the Swedish choral director Eric Ericson had an enormous impact on a cappella choral development not only in Sweden but around the world, and finally there are a large number of very popular primary and secondary schools (music schools) with high admission standards based on auditions that combine a rigid academic regimen with high level choral singing on every school day, a system that started with Adolf Fredrik\\'s Music School in Stockholm in 1939 but has spread over the country.\\n\\nQuestion: What is the name of the Swedish man known for being a large influence to a cappella across the world?\\nAns: Eric Ericson\\nHere is a question about this article: Poultry meat and eggs provide nutritionally beneficial food containing protein of high quality.

In the Lithuanian language nobles were named ponai. The higher nobility were named \\'kunigai\\' or \\'kunigaikščiai\\' (dukes)—i.e., loanword from Scandinavic konung. They were the established local leaders and warlords. During the development of the state they gradually became subordinated to higher dukes, and later to the King of Lithuania. Because of expansion of Lithuanian duchy into lands of Ruthenia in the mid of 14th century a new term appeared to denominate nobility bajorai—from Ruthenian (modern Ukrainian and Belarusian languages) бояре. This word to this day is used in Lithuanian language to name nobility, not only for own, but also for nobility of other countries.\\n\\nQuestion: What word is used to denominate nobility?\\nAns:'},\n",

But he said he was open to the idea of some limits on housing benefit, putting himself at odds with Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes who said last night: ‘We’ve not signed up to cutting housing benefit and I don’t imagine for a moment we will.\\' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today ruled out banning under-25s from claiming housing benefit, after meeting with U2 frontman Bono yesterday to discuss global poverty. Mr Clegg was taking questions from voters in Sheffield, where he is an MP, the day after meeting U2 frontman Bono to discuss tackling poverty. Chancellor George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary this week set out plans to cut the benefits bill by a further £10billion. And in his conference speech, David Cameron said he wanted to ‘look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25’. But Mr Clegg said he could ‘knock both ideas on the head.’ ‘The idea that of that £16billion [welfare budget] we are just going to scoop out £10billion from welfare which will inevitably hit the poorest before asking anything of the wealthiest, no. Flatly no. Of course not. ‘What I am looking for is as the country unfortunately has to carry on tightening our belts for some time in the future, who should tighten their belts first. ‘I just start from the very simple principle that when we are all having to make sacrifices you ask people at the top and then work down you don’t ask people at the bottom and work up,’ he told BBC Radio 5Live. But Mr Clegg admitted it was ‘unrealistic’ to think that no savings could be made from welfare. Limiting housing benefit was a key policy announcement at the Tory conference in Birmingham this week. David Cameron used his speech at the Tory party conference this week to argue under-25s should not receive housing benefit. Mr Cameron said: ‘If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don’t?’ But Mr Clegg ruled out a ‘complete blanket ban on providing housing benefit to anyone who so happens to\\xa0 have been born 25 years ago or less’. He said parents aged under-25 should be allowed to continue to claim state help with housing costs. ‘Because there are people who have got kids, who have suffered abuse, who have suffered terrible trauma in their families, who of course as a passionate society we have got to support them. ‘But do I think there might be some under-25-year-olds who don’t need all the support they get in the same way that under-25-year-olds who aren’t on housing benefit have to make their way... ‘Do I think we need to look for further savings in welfare, unambiguously yes.’ However, last night Mr Hughes vowed to block any Tory plans to remove housing benefit from those aged under-25. Speaking on the BBC\\'s Question Time last night, he said: \\'It is not a done deal across the Coalition and I would not agree to it as proposed – I’m very clear about that. \\'Are you really saying we should be depriving a 23-year-old mum of the money she needs to keep the roof over the head of her two-year-olds? \\'I’m for collecting more money from the people who are very well-off in this country. Let’s collect money from people who can afford to pay, not take money from youngsters who are struggling with all the other pressures.\\' Mr Hughes, who does not sit around the Cabinet table but is on the back benches, said his party leader agreed that the plans had to be blocked. \\'Nick does agree with me,\\' he said. \\'We’ve not signed up to cutting housing benefit and I don’t imagine for a moment we will.\\'\\nHighlights: Deputy Prime Minister says he will \\'knock on the head\\' Tory plans for tough cuts to welfare. Lib Dem leader\\'s refusal to back big cut to handouts puts him on collision course with Tories.\\n\\nText: A mailman has taken inspiration from popular children’s cartoon Postman Pat – carrying out his deliveries with a cat companion.

Not satisfied with a mere 25 miles, Rudy hopes that he will be able to do 100 miles with MJ by next September. ‘People don\\'t know what to make of it - they always do a double-take. ‘I don\\'t get to see most reactions. When I do hear people yell, I typically hear \"Oh my God, he has a cat on. his shoulder! That\\'s so cute\". ‘People always come up and want to pet her and are blown away by the fact she arrived via bicycle. ‘MJ is so comfortable on my shoulder she never uses her claws. My shoulder and back are scratch free.’ Daily ride: MJ follows her owner Rudi to work every day and enjoys the speed of the ride - and the attention from passers by.

Emma Moody was crossing a field in St Martin, Cornwall, when her dog disturbed a herd of cows and their young calves. After the cow began to charge at her, a terrified Ms Moody attempted to run away but tripped and fell into its path. Horror: A woman was airlifted to hospital after a cow charged at her before rolling and sitting on her. The accident happened in a field in St Martin, Cornwall. The village is pictured. The cow then trampled and rolled on her - breaking most of her ribs and leaving her with severe chest injuries. A Navy search and rescue helicopter from nearby RNAS Culdrose was dispatched to the farm where crews found her lying badly hurt in a meadow. She was airlifted to hospital where she today remains in a critical condition.

'It’s not as if she was in a strange area or somewhere different where she didn’t know the farm or the walk. 'We are eternally grateful for the speed she was taken to hospital and treated - it was second to none.'

Loubna Khader sobbed and smacked the glass divider at the Tarrant County Jail in Fort Worth, Texas as she came face-to-face with Stewart Richardson, who is still awaiting trial for the 2009 crash due to legal wrangling and appeals. 'It's been five years today! Five. years!' Khader yelled at Richardson, WFAA-TV reported. 'My son is dying every single day... I am never going to. forgive you for what you did to my son!' Mrs Khader, her husband and her then two-year-old son Abdallah were driving back from a family gathering when Richardson rear-ended them, leaving the little boy trapped in his seat. Scroll down for video. Confrontation: Loubna Khader is pictured yelling at Stewart Richardson - the man who smashed into the back of her family's car 5 years ago after allegedly drunk driving. The crash left her son, then 2, brain damaged. Anger: Khader is pictured yelling at Richardson and telling him that his apologies would change nothing. After the accident, doctors predicted. that he had suffered damage to 80 per cent of his brain. He is now unable to. see, speak or walk and needs around-the-clock care. WFAA was there to film the moment Khader confronted Richardson, whose alcohol blood level was allegedly three times the limit when he crashed into the back of the family. She raised an image showing Abdallah before the crash and then swapped it with one showing his bandaged face. Richardson looked down as the mother yelled at him. He stayed for the entirely of her tirade and repeatedly apologized for her - but she would not accept it. Changed: Abdallah, pictured left before the accident and right afterwards, became trapped in his child seat when Richardson rear-ended the family's car. He is now unable to see, talk, walk or care for himself. Devastated: Khader said after the meeting that she has tried to forgive Richardson but she can't. Face to face: Khader showed Richardson photos of her son before and after the life-changing crash. 'I'm supposed to go home now and my son is going to be okay, because you said you’re sorry?' she said, before instructing him to be sent back to his cell. Khader, who was unsure if Richardson would agree to meet her, had invited along the cameras to raise an understanding of her family's suffering and the long-term effects of drunk driving. After the confrontation, she said: 'There's so many more things I wanted to tell him about my son -. the things he goes through daily, but a man like him would. never feel stuff like this.' She said that, while the meeting was the start of her healing process and made her feel better, she will never be able to forgive the man who destroyed her son's life. Remorse: Richardson, pictured left in his 2009 booking picture and right during the confrontation, said he had wanted to meet with Khader to let her know that he thinks about her son every day. Daily struggle: Khader is pictured with Abdallah, who now requires around-the-clock care. 'I don't think there will ever be. peace with this man,' she said. 'I tried so many times to convince. myself to forgive him, because it's not going to change anything. But. the minute I saw him, I just saw the devil in him.' Richardson said he wanted to meet with Khader so she knows he thinks of her family every day. 'I made a mistake,' he told the news channel. 'And I want that family to know I’m trying to stand up for my mistake. To let them know that I love them, and I'm very sorry for what happened.' He added that he keeps a news clipping of the accident in his cell so that he is always reminded of the crash. He said the family are the first people in his prayers. His trial is on hold until an appeals. court considers a request by prosecutors to use prior drunken driving. charges in the case. He had seven prior arrests for DUI.

Her husband showed little emotion.\\nMitigating for her after conviction, David Hislop QC said: \"At 60 years of age, hers has been a tragic fall from grace... a period of incarceration will be made even more difficult for her, knowing the stigma attached to her convictions will carry on forever.\"\\nTony Wadsworth\\'s lawyer, Michelle Clarke, said the hardest thing for him would be being separated from his wife.\\nSpeaking after the case, David Rouse, a senior prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said the couple had lived \"double lives\".\\n\"In their public and professional lives they were a couple who came across as caring, warm and respectable.\\n\"However, in their private lives, they preyed on young, impressionable victims for their own sexual gratification.\"\\nHe thanked the victims for their courage in bringing \"two sexual predators to justice\".\\nDet Sgt Rhys Bower, from Warwickshire Police, said: \"These two individuals gave no thought to the impact their actions were having on the young boys they abused; they were only concerned with their own gratification.\"\\nThe NSPCC said: \"The Wadsworths\\' behaviour has been exposed for what it is - child sexual abuse.\\n\"Julie Wadsworth\\'s fatuous claim in court that she was a victim in this case is insulting.\\n\"The true victims were young boys who were repeatedly encouraged to engage in illegal sexual activity.\"\\nA BBC spokesman said the Wadsworths were last on air in December 2015 and no longer work for the corporation.\\n\\nA: Two former BBC radio presenters have each been jailed for five years for indecently assaulting under-age boys.\\n\\n\\nQ: The Edinburgh-based partnership had revenue of Â£53.3m in the year to July, up 4% on the previous year.\\nProfits slipped by 3% to Â£22.6m, a figure which represents a 40% profit margin.\\nIt is claimed this resulted from \"a significant pause in activity and client instructions\".\\nPhilip Rodney, the chairman of the legal partnership, said: \"The anticipation of, and the changed circumstances brought about by the outcome of the EU referendum, inevitably impacted adversely on the last couple of months\\' trading and are reflected in our results.\\n\"The decision to leave the EU has been felt widely, as can be seen from organisations reporting across all sectors of the UK business community.\\n\"While there will continue to be uncertainties, we are beginning to experience nearer normal market conditions as we work with our clients to support them in these changed circumstances.\"\\nBurness Paull employs 500 people at offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, of whom 59 are partners.\\nIt specialises in property and infrastructure, as well as corporate deal-making, particularly in finance and oil and gas.\\n\\nA:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Article: Repeated mountings will encourage the horse to stand still when it’s mounted. Further reinforce the behavior by rewarding the horse with a pat and a treat for not moving off as you mount. Just make sure not to give the horse treats or praise when it wanders off or moves as you mount.  Each time you mount your horse, give it a treat from the saddle. This makes your horse associate mounting with treats, which will make being mounted a more positive experience. Many horses take at least 2 weeks to become used to being mounted. If the horse stops in response to your correction, reward it immediately with a pat and a carrot or other treat. Food can be a powerful motivator for horses, so if the horse knows that it will get a tasty treat for standing still to be mounted, it is much less likely to walk away or shift position. If the horse is stubborn and will not stop, just keep putting your foot in the stirrup, without trying to mount. When the horse finally stays still, reward it with a treat. Repeat until it consistently stays still for this stage. Once you are seated, sit still for 10-12 seconds before you start riding. Take this time to slip your right foot into the stirrup and make sure you have a strong grip on the reins. When you do decide to move, it should be your decision, not the horse’s. Once the horse understands this, it’ll stand still once you’ve mounted until you direct it forwards. Enjoy the ride! If you start riding as soon as your rear end hits the saddle, the horse will anticipate this and start to move away before you’re fully seated.\\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\\nMount the horse 6-7 times until it stands still each time you mount it.

The larger the piece of paper you\\'re using, the more opportunity you\\'ll have to add details and other pieces once the body is finished. 1x1 feet is a good place to start if you\\'re unsure what size you want. With the square facing towards you, take each half of the paper and pull it to the centre line of your square. If you\\'re having difficulty with where the center should be, measure it out with a ruler and draw a thin line using a pencil. One of these individual folds on either side is referred to as a valley fold. The two folds together comprise a gate fold. This is because the resulting folds should look like a gate that\\'s ready to open up. Once you have your first gatefold complete it\\'s time to do the same from another angle. Unfold the gatefold you originally made. Turn the square 90 degrees and pull the two new halves together to make a new \"gate.\" Unfold once you\\'re done. After unfolding two gate folds, you should have a grid with folds that make sixteen squares. From there, fold the square across diagonally in both directions, unfolding the paper after each time. These folds will become useful when it comes time to fold your battleship into shape. This is where your boat will begin to take form. Turn the paper over on its opposing face. Push the corners upward to make an upside-down pyramid. When you have accomplished this, take each of the four corners and fold them down. Turn the boat over when you have completed these folds. It\\'s now ready for decorating.  When you have completed your inside reverse folds, you should have a square pyramid shape in the centre, with four arms jutting horizontally from the pyramid\\'s corners. The inside reverse fold is a potentially tricky fold to master in origami. It\\'s worthwhile to figure out the individual fold before you move on with it in practice.\\n++++++++++\\nOne-sentence summary --\\n'},\n",

It featured the singles \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\" and \"Another One Bites the Dust\", both of which reached number one in the US. After attending a Queen concert in Los Angeles, Michael Jackson suggested to Mercury backstage that \"Another One Bites the Dust\" be released as a single, and in October 1980 it spent three weeks at number one. The album topped the Billboard 200 for five weeks, and sold over four million copies in the US. It was also the first appearance of a synthesiser on a Queen album. Heretofore, their albums featured a distinctive \"No Synthesisers!\" sleeve note. The note is widely assumed to reflect an anti-synth, pro-\"hard\"-rock stance by the band, but was later revealed by producer Roy Thomas Baker to be an attempt to clarify that those albums\\' multi-layered solos were created with guitars, not synths, as record company executives kept assuming at the time. In September 1980, Queen performed three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden. In 1980, Queen also released the soundtrack they had recorded for Flash Gordon. At the 1981 American Music Awards in January, \"Another One Bites the Dust\" won the award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single, and Queen were nominated for Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group.\\nWhich musical artist suggested Queen release Another One Bites the Dust as a single?\\nThe answer is the following: Michael Jackson\\n\\nProblem: Natural uranium consists of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing spontaneous fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-236 and -240, which appear in the decay chain of primordial plutonium-244.

This is possibly the earliest extant exemplar of the Quran, but as the tests allow a range of possible dates, it cannot be said with certainty which of the existing versions is the oldest.

He later met Rose Caylor, a writer, and together they left Chicago (and his family) in 1924, moving to New York. He was divorced from Armstrong in 1925. He married Caylor that same year, and they remained married until Hechts death in 1964. On July 30th, 1943 Ben and Rose had a daughter, Jenny Hecht, who became an actress at the age of 8, and first appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show playing the role of Helen Hayes in \"The Helen Hayes Story,\" 1951.

The Giants tried to come back in the fourth quarter as kicker Lawrence Tynes booted a 20-yard field goal, yet safety Antrel Rolle\\'s final interception of the game sealed the deal for Arizona.\\n\\nHow many yards was the shortest touchdown pass?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n6\\n\\n\\nquestion: The largest population centres of the Sinhalese diaspora are mainly situated in Europe, North America and Australia. The city of Melbourne contains just under half of the Sri Lankan Australians. The 2011 census recorded 86,412 Sri Lanka born in Australia. There are 73,849 Australians (0.4 of the population) who reported having Sinhalese ancestry in 2006. The Sinhalese language was also reported to be the 29th-fastest-growing language in Australia (ranking above Somali language but behind Hindi language and Belarusian language). Sinhalese Australians have an exceptionally low rate of return migration to Sri Lanka. In the Canada 2011 Census, 7,220 people identified themselves as of Sri Lankan Canadians, out of 139,415 Sri Lankans. There are a small amount of Sri Lankans in India, scattered around the country, but mainly living in and around the North India and South India regions. Sri Lankan New Zealanders comprised 3% of the Asian population of New Zealand in 2001. The numbers arriving continued to increase, and at the 2006 census there were over 7,000 Sri Lankans living in New Zealand. The Sri Lankan American number about 12,000 in the U.S. The New York City Metropolitan Area contains the largest Sri Lankan community in the United States, receiving the highest legal permanent resident Sri Lankan immigrant population, followed by Central New Jersey and the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Many Sri Lankans in Italy have migrated to Italy since the 1970s. Italy was attractive to the Sinhalese due to perceived easier employment opportunities and entry, compared to other European countries. It is estimated that there are 30,000-33,000 Sinhalese in Italy. The major Sinhalese communities in Italy are located in Lombardia (In the districts Loreto and Lazzaretto), Milan, Lazio, Rome, Naples, and Southern Italy (Particularly Palermo, Messina and Catania). Though British Sri Lankans people in particular and Sri Lankans in general have migrated to the UK over the centuries beginning from the colonial times, the number of Sinhalese people in the UK cannot be estimated accurately due to inadequacies of census in the UK. The UK government does not record statistics on the basis of language or ethnicity and all Sri Lankans are classified into one group as Asian British or Asian Other.\\nAnswer this question: How many Sri Lankans in Canada in 2011 did not identify as Sri Lankan Canadians?\\nanswer: 132195\\n\\n\\nquestion: In the county, the population was spread out with 22.7% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 18 to 24, 28.9% from 25 to 44, 26.7% from 45 to 64, and 12.7% who were 65 years of age or older.

       "    'content': 'Q: Coming off their win over the Browns, Washington traveled to Lincoln Financial Field for a rematch with the rival Philadelphia Eagles, who they beat 31-6 in Week 11. In the first, Philadelphia got the ball first, and subsequently got on the board first, as well, taking the opening kickoff and going on a drive in which they converted two fourth downs, and ended with quarterback Nick Foles finding wide receiver Jeremy Maclin for a 27-yard score and a 7-0 lead. Washington would be unable to answer in the quarter. In the second, Washington had good field position, as Richard Crawford had just recovered a Foles fumble and Washington converted the fumble into a Kai Forbath 45-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 7-3. Forbath\\'s field goal was his 16th consecutive field goal to start his career, tying an NFL record. Following a Philadelphia punt, Washington drove and called on Forbath again, this time from 42 yards, and he delivered to cut the lead to 7-6. This field goal was his 17th consecutive make, setting an NFL mark for consecutive field goals made to start a career. On Philadelphia\\'s ensuing possession, Foles was intercepted by London Fletcher, and Washington got the ball at the Eagles\\' 25. Washington turned Philadelphia\\'s second turnover of the quarter into a Josh Morgan 13-yard touchdown pass from Robert Griffin III, back in after missing last week\\'s game, for a 13-7 lead. Philadelphia would answer with an Alex Henery 38-yard field goal to cut the Washington lead to 13-10 at the half. In the third, Washington got the ball first, and drove down the field, capping off the drive with a 10-yard touchdown run by Alfred Morris to extend its advantage to 20-10. Philadelphia would respond with Henery connecting again, this time from 30 yards out, to cut the lead to 20-13. After exchanging punts, Washington got the ball back again, and this time Griffin found Santana Moss in the corner of the endzone for a 22-yard score and a 27-13 advantage. After a Philadelphia punt, Washington tried to drive down the field in an attempt to put the game on ice, but Griffin\\'s pass was overthrown and intercepted by Colt Anderson of Philadelphia, and Philadelphia converted that into a Dion Lewis 17-yard scamper to cut Washington\\'s advantage to 27-20. After Washington could not extend its advantage, Philadelphia got the ball back, and got into the red zone in the game\\'s final minute. Despite an open Maclin in the endzone, Foles short-hopped the pass, and then tight end Evan Moore dropped another, and the Eagles had one final play. With 8 seconds remaining, Foles was pressured, threw an incomplete pass that did not reach the line of scrimmage, resulting in an illegal forward pass, and with only 1 second on the clock, the 1 second was run off due to the ten-second runoff rule, and Washington barely hung on for a 27-20 win. With the nail-biting win, Washington improved to 9-6, 4-1 in the NFC East, winning six straight for the first time since 1996, clinching a winning record against the NFC East for the first time since 2005 and a winning overall record for the first time since 2007. Additionally, the win guaranteed that they would be in control of their own destiny in their season finale against the Dallas Cowboys.  This is also the team\\'s first seasonal sweep over the Eagles since 2008.\\nhow many yards did morgan pass?\\nA: 13\\n\\n\\nProblem: In 1930, Sténio Vincent, a long-time critic of the occupation, was elected President. By 1930, President Hoover had become concerned about the effects of the occupation, particularly after the December 1929 incident in Les Cayes. Hoover appointed a commission to study the situation, with William Cameron Forbes as the chair.:232-233 The Forbes Commission praised the material improvements that the U.S. administration had achieved, but it criticized the continued exclusion of Haitian nationals from positions of real authority in the government and the constabulary, which had come to be known as the Garde d\\'Haïti. In more general terms, the commission asserted that \"the social forces that created  still remain - poverty, ignorance, and the lack of a tradition or desire for orderly free government.\" The Hoover administration did not fully implement the recommendations of the Forbes Commission; but United States withdrawal was under way by 1932, when Hoover lost the presidency to Franklin D. Roosevelt. The latter as Assistant Secretary of the Navy had overall responsibility for drafting the most recent Haitian constitution; he was a proponent of the \"Good Neighbor policy\" for the US role in the Caribbean and Latin America. On a visit to Cap-Haïtien in July 1934, Roosevelt reaffirmed an August 1933 disengagement agreement. The last contingent of U.S. Marines departed on August 15, 1934 after a formal transfer of authority to the Garde. The U.S. retained influence on Haiti\\'s external finances until 1947.\\nAnswer this question based on the article: Who appointed Forbes?\\nA: Hoover\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nStill searching for their first win of the year, the Rams flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 4 showdown with the Dallas Cowboys.  After a scoreless first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Cowboys RB Julius Jones got a 2-yard TD run.  Later in the period, the Rams would get their only score of the game as WR Dante Hall returned a punt 85&#160;yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, Dallas regained the lead with QB Tony Romo getting a 15-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Cowboys managed to put the game away with Romo hooking up with WR Patrick Crayton on a 59-yard and a 37-yard TD pass.  Afterwards, the scoring ended with Romo\\'s 17-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten.

Bomb was loaded with steel pellets, ball bearings and other shrapnel to cause maximum damage. Victims were laid to rest on Saturday - which was declared a day of mourning by the provincial government. Thousands took to the streets in Sindh province and Kerachi the same day to protest against the killings. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the killings only strengthened government's resolve to stop terrorism.\\n****\\nA: Thousands of Shiite Muslims took to the streets of Pakistan to protest against the deaths of 61 worshippers, who were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a mosque during Friday prayers. The sectarian attack - the worst to hit the country in almost two years - took place at a mosque\\xa0in the Shikarpur district of southern Sindh province, about 300 miles north of Pakistan's biggest city Karachi. Thousands attended funeral prayers for the dead on Saturday, which had been designated a day of mourning by the provincial government, while others protested against the bombings. Scroll down for video. Horror: 61 worshippers were killed when a suicide bomber walked into the middle of a mosque during Friday prayers. Devastating: A police officer said the bomb was loaded with steel pellets, ball bearings and other shrapnel to cause maximum damage. Distraught: A day of mourning was declared by the government in\\xa0southern Sindh province, closing businesses across the area. Shocking: The attack at the mosque in the Shikarpur district was the most violent in Pakistan since March 2013. Local television broadcast footage of huge crowds of mostly Shiite Muslims, carrying black flags and beating their chests as they offered their prayers, one after another. Karachi, Pakistan's economic heart and Sindh's provincial capital, also shut down for the day, with hundreds of Shiites staging protest rallies. Police said unidentified 'miscreants' had set fire to a passenger bus and a truck in the city early in the day, but no one was hurt. Police on Saturday said the devastating explosion was a suicide attack, and the bomber detonated the explosives strapped to his body 'in the middle of the mosque'. 'The bomber selected a place in the mosque that would cause huge destruction,' Raja Umar Khitab, a police official in Sindh's counter-terror department, said. Khitab said the bomb was loaded with steel pellets, ball bearings and other shrapnel to cause maximum damage. Protests: Thousands attended the funerals, with more people taking to the streets to protest against sectarian attacks like this one. Grief: Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\\xa0said on Saturday the whole nation was in mourning after Friday's bombing. Funerals: As people prayed for the dead, Prime Minister Sharif\\xa0vowed the attack would strengthen the government's resolve to stop terrorism. Rising: There has been an increase in sectarian violence over the past couple of years in Pakistan. Hardline: Most of the violence has been perpetrated by hardline Sunni Muslim groups against the minority Sunnis. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said the whole nation was in mourning after the bombing, but vowed that it would strengthen the government's resolve to stop terrorism. Pakistan 'will win the war against terrorism at any cost', he told a crowd of almost 1,000 counter-terrorism officers in eastern Lahore city. Pakistan has suffered a rising tide of sectarian violence in recent years, most of it perpetrated by hardline Sunni Muslim groups against minority Shiites, who make up around 20 per cent of the population. Friday's bombing was the bloodiest single sectarian attack in Pakistan since March 2013, when a car bomb in a Shiite neighbourhood of Karachi killed 45. A spokesman for the shadowy Jandullah militant group, a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, said they were behind the latest blast. Injured: Relatives help an injured blast victim at a hospital following Friday's bomb explosion at the mosque. Abandoned: Shoes, left at the entrance by worshippers, were left behind after the blast tore through the mosque. Horrific: Hundreds of people had been attending Friday prayers at the mosque when the suicide bomber detonated his explosives. Prayers: As the community mourned its loss, the Jandullah militant group claimed responsibility for the bombing. Planned: The suicide bomber had apparently chosen his spot in the mosque carefully, so it would have the maximum impact. Anti-Shiite attacks have been increasing in recent years in Karachi and also in the southwestern city of Quetta, the northwestern area of Parachinar and the far northeastern town of Gilgit. Around 1,000 Shiites have been killed in the past two years in Pakistan, with many of the attacks claimed by the hardline Sunni group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Pakistan has stepped up its fight against militants in the past month, following a Taliban massacre at a school in the northwestern city of Peshawar. Heavily armed gunmen went from room to room at the army-run school gunning down 150 people, most of them children, in an attack that horrified the world. Since then, the government has ended a six-year moratorium on executions in terror-related cases and pledged to crack down on all militant groups. Death toll: About 1,000 Sunnis have been killed in sectarian violence in Pakistan over the last two years. Massacre: The suicide bombing comes just two months after gunmen stormed a school, killing 150 people - mainly children. Death sentence: The Pakistani government has bought in executions in terror-related cases and pledged to crack down on all militant groups.\\n\\n\\nQ: Washroom in Walton-on-Thames sold for more than four times its estimate.

A puppy needed a three hour operation after swallowing a sewing needle which became lodged in her spinal cord. Eight month old golden Labrador Fudge survived the operation unscathed and without any permanent damage despite the 1.5 inch needle piercing soft tissue and becoming lodged in the joint of her spine and skull. The needle was only discovered after Fudge collapsed screaming in pain while out on a walk and x-rays and exploratory surgery on her stomach failed to get to the root of the puppy\\'s agony. Lucky: Paul Manville, with Labrador puppy Fudge who survived swallowing a needle and it becoming lodged in her spine. Painful: An x-ray image shows a 1.5 inch needle lodged in Fudge\\'s spinal cord. Owner Paul Manville, 45, said: \\'Fudge had broken through the stair gate and demolished the bedroom - she played with a couple of plastic hairbrushes and had bitten them. \\'Then three days later when I took her for a walk she dropped to the floor and screamed in pain. \\'I thought she had swallowed something and had something in her stomach so I took her to the vets. \\'She had an x-ray of her stomach but it didn\\'t show anything so they decided to open her up and have a look at it anyway. He added: \\'But they still didn\\'t find anything and her agony remained a mystery. \\'It was really stressful as she was still having fits of pain and we thought we were going to have to put her down. \\'The next day I took her back to the vets and they X-rayed her head and neck and that\\'s when they found the needle lodged.\\' Mystery: The needle was only discovered after Fudge collapsed screaming in pain while out on a walk and x-rays and exploratory surgery on her stomach failed to get to the root of the puppy\\'s agony. Agony: A scan picture shows the needle lodged in Fudge\\'s spinal cord. She needed a three-hour operation to have it removed. Paul, who did not have pet insurance and had to fork out £4,500 pounds on vet bills for Fudge, took the dog 90 miles north to the Royal Veterinary College, Hertfordshire, to remove the needle. Colin Driver, one of the vets who operated on Fudge, said: \\'You don\\'t expect to see a dog with a needle in their spinal cord so we were very shocked, it was quite extraordinary. \\'We had to be extremely careful not to move the spinal cord when we removed the needle, as like in humans it is connected to all the nerve endings and could leave permanent damage. Costly: Fudge\\'s owner Paul had to shell out £4,500 on vets fees as he had no pet insurance. \\'Afterwards I had expected to see some swelling which might have made Fudge weak or have neurological problems. \\'I told the owner not to expect her to walk the next day but she was up walking around with no problems and was back to her normal self. \\'We were really pleased.\\' Paul said Fudge is now fully recovered and has been playing with his other Labrador, Shadow, ten.\\n\\nWrite highlights.\\nLabrador puppy Fudge swallowed the 1.5 inch needle while exploring. She collapsed in agony while out walking with owner Paul Manville. X-rays and examinations of her stomach found no problem. But a chance x-ray showed a needle lodged in her spine. Owner wasn\\'t insured and paid out £4,500 for the operation.\\nProblem: Two-thirds of Americans think that the Republicans in Congress are not doing enough to cooperate with President Obama, according to a new national poll. But a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey, released Wednesday, also indicates the public believes the Democrats should be the ones to take the first step toward bipartisan cooperation and they want the Democrats to give up more than the GOP to reach a consensus. Sixty-seven percent of respondents say the GOP is not doing enough to cooperate with the White House, up 6 points from last April. Americans appear split on whether the president is doing enough to reach out to Republicans, with 52 percent saying Obama is not doing enough to cooperate with the GOP, while 47 percent say he is doing enough to reach across the political aisle. The 52 percent who say the president\\'s not doing enough to encourage bipartisanship is up 16 points from last April. \"That\\'s a big change from last spring, when Obama was still in the honeymoon phase of his first term,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \"Congressional Republicans were familiar to Americans, but Obama was new to them, so his early attempts to reach out to the GOP continued to resonate even after it became clear that bipartisanship was not within easy reach.\" Even though more people think Republicans are not doing enough to reach bipartisan consensus, 54 percent believe the Democratic party should take the first step toward developing bipartisan solutions to the country\\'s problems, the survey says. Forty-two percent say the GOP should take that first step. Just over half of those questioned say the Democrats should give up more ground to achieve bipartisanship, while 43 percent want to see the GOP make more compromises. \"Americans feel the ball is in the Democrats\\' court,\" Holland added. \"They may not be held responsible for the problem, but since they are in charge of the government, Americans appear to think they are responsible for the solution.\" According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the government in this country is broken, but the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what\\'s broken can be fixed. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey\\'s sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\\nSummarize this article.\\n\\nAnswer:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Q: Vestique is AWESOME. I found this website on Pinterest and was super excited when I saw how cute and affordable their dresses are; I knew having the website on-hand would come in handy one day and it certainly did!   I ordered a cute little sundress for a late summer wedding. I was thrilled with the price - somewhere in the $30 range - and the dress actually ended up being cuter in real life than it was online.   I was amazed at how quickly they shipped the dress - I really felt like they shipped it within minutes of me ordering it. Unfortunately, I ordered a size too big. Since the wedding was that weekend I decided to simply order a second dress in the right size so that I would be sure to have it for that weekend. I\\'m not even sure that\\'s necessary - those girls are ON POINT with shipping items out and the return was fast and easy, too!    This place will absolutely be my new go-to for cute dresses and tops. Good customer service goes a long way with me, and this place certainly understands the benefit in providing above and beyond customer service. OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n\\nA: positive\\n\\nQ: Wow! Place seemed like a hit. I hade a 2 item combo! Shrimp which was ehhhh frozen restaurant warehouse boxed shrimp. Fried clams which were 5 stars. I had potato salad and for 1.50 extra a crab soup. Pretty fair place. I have been to them all hot n juicy and boiling crab. The problem? It\\'s 245 am approximately 12 hours ago I was finishing up. I\\'m now sitting on the bowl and have a case of brown water. With what is now my 3rd round of barfing. Incubation period for food  poisoning is 9 to 12 hours.......... BINGO. So thanks guys from the bottom of my .......... Fart OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n\\nA: negative\\n\\nQ: If there was a way to give a place NEGATIVE stars, I would.  I was told by a friend when I moved out here that these salons had the dumbest staff members around but other than that were good salons.  She could not have been more correct. I have never met a group of more incompetent,  unprofessional people in my life.  I pay for the VIP All Inclusive membership so that I can tan whenever I want in whatever bed or use any service that I want.  This membership is $100. (Not cheap). I had an issue with freezing my account that has taken me nearly TWO MONTHS to get cleared up, haven\\'t been able to tan although I was continuing to PAY my monthly membership,  and then had a bunch of MYSTERY fee\\'s ($75 worth) that NO ONE seemed to know anything about on my account.  Each and every time I went in I spoke with a new employee who was just as baffled as the one before, never receiving any help.  The girls that work there are virtually useless (by no fault of their own) because they aren\\'t allowed to view and/or correct any errors or make any changes to accounts without a manager\\'s help. They suggested that I call \"corporate\" although I was told by more than one of the employees that \"they probably won\\'t answer or call back because they won\\'t even call their employees back to help them with issues\". That was extremely accurate.  I called FOUR times and left messages because the phone just rings off the hook and no one answers and no one EVER called me back. Finally one girl got a hold of her \"manager\" on her cell phone and I spoke to her and have NEVER had a more DISRESPECTFUL BITCH on the other line in my life. Her name was RAINA and she was BEYOND unprofessional.  Not only did she CUT ME OFF with EVERY sentence I tried to get out, but she then proceeded to HANG UP on me. Since then she was apparently DEMOTED (nothing to do with me so she probably did the same to more than one person) but in my opinion she should be FIRED and NEVER hired anywhere else ever again as she clearly has neither proper customer service skills nor common sense. I contacted BBB and specifically reported HER along with my complaint. She deserves a slap in the face.   Good beds,  but you will have to figure out how to use them completely on your own because the girls will sit at the front desk on their cell phones and no one will show you what to do. You\\'re better off in the sun.  Wouldn\\'t recommend this place to ANYONE OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n\\nA: negative\\n\\nQ: When this place first opened the customer service was horrendous. I stopped going there. Stayed away for years. I recently started going again as it is on my way to work. And I have to say the customer service has been outstanding my emails of complaints helped. The bagels are good. The breakfast sandwiches are also pretty good. But the 4 cheese souffle, now that is the shining star.It is so flaky and soft, the flavor incredible. I think 4.00 for 1 is a bit much. But for that occasional treat well worth the price.  Bravo to the staff, always very friendly. OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n\\nA:'},\n",

Mass-produced clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be sweatshops, typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in developing countries, clothes made in industrialized nations may also be manufactured similarly, often staffed by undocumented immigrants.[citation needed]\\nQuestion: Most examples of what are found in industrial countries?\\n\\nOutput: unanswerable\\n\\nQUES: The toponym Schwyz itself is first attested in 972, as Old High German Suittes, ultimately perhaps related to suedan \"to burn\", referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build. The name was extended to the area dominated by the canton, and after the Swabian War of 1499 gradually came to be used for the entire Confederation. The Swiss German name of the country, Schwiiz, is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement, but distinguished by the use of the definite article (d\\'Schwiiz for the Confederation, but simply Schwyz for the canton and the town).\\n\\nAt what time did the name Schwyz begin to be used by the entire Confederation?\\nWhat is the answer?\\nANS: after the Swabian War of 1499\\n\\nQUES: Being identified as either \"black\" or \"white\" in Australia during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one\\'s employment and social prospects. Various state-based Aboriginal Protection Boards were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents. Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour. The social position of mixed-race or \"half-caste\" individuals varied over time. A 1913 report by Sir Baldwin Spencer states that:\\nWhat did the Aboriginal Protection Boards control?\\n\\nANS: where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents.\\n\\nSchwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron (1977), elements of which were dramatized; in 1991, he purchased the rights to the film, its outtakes, and associated still photography.

Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk, but did not win the role because of his height. Later, Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner\\'s alter ego. Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain.

       "    'content': 'Problem: Background: Belushi\\'s mother, Agnes Demetri (Samaras), was the daughter of Albanian immigrants, and his father, Adam Anastos Belushi, was an Albanian immigrant from Qyteze. Born in Humboldt Park, a neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago, Illinois, John was raised in Wheaton, a suburb west of Chicago, along with his three siblings: younger brothers Billy and Jim, and sister Marian. Belushi was raised in the Albanian Orthodox Church and attended Wheaton Community High School, where he met his future wife, Judith Jacklin. In 1965, Belushi formed a band, the Ravens, together with four fellow high school students (Dick Blasucci, Michael Blasucci, Tony Pavolonis and Phil Special).\\nContext: In 1975 Chevy Chase and writer Michael O\\'Donoghue recommended Belushi to Lorne Michaels as a potential member for a television show Michaels was about to produce called Saturday Night a.k.a. Saturday Night Live (SNL). Michaels was initially undecided, as he was not sure if Belushi\\'s physical humor would fit with what he was envisioning, but he changed his mind after giving Belushi an audition.  Over his four-year tenure at SNL, Belushi developed a series of successful characters, including the belligerent Samurai Futaba, Henry Kissinger, Ludwig van Beethoven, the Greek owner of the Olympia Cafe, Captain James T. Kirk, and a contributor of furious opinion pieces on Weekend Update, during which he coined his catchphrase, \"But N-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!\" With Aykroyd, Belushi created Jake and Elwood, the Blues Brothers. Originally intended to warm up the crowd before the show, the Blues Brothers were eventually featured as music guests. Belushi also reprised his Lemmings imitation of Joe Cocker. Cocker himself joined Belushi in 1976 to sing together Feeling Alright.  Like many of his SNL fellow cast members, Belushi began experimenting heavily with drugs to deal with the constant pressure. His unpredictable temper caused him to be fired (and immediately re-hired) by Michaels a number of times. In Rolling Stone\\'s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 SNL cast members to that time, Belushi received the top ranking. \"Belushi was the \\'live\\' in Saturday Night Live,\" they wrote, \"the one who made the show happen on the edge ... Nobody embodied the highs and lows of SNL like Belushi.\"\\nQuestion: What other shows did John Belushi work on?\\nAnswer: \\n\\nProblem: Background: Robert Owen (; 14 May 1771 - 17 November 1858) was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of utopian socialism and the cooperative movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities.\\nContext: Although Owen made brief visits to the United States, London became his permanent home and the centre of his activities in 1828. After an extended period of friction with William Allen and some of his other business partners, Owen relinquished all of connections to New Lanark. He is often quoted as comment Allen at the time, \"All the world is queer save thee and me, and even thou art a little queer\". Having invested most of his personal fortune in the failed New Harmony communal experiment, Owen was no longer a wealthy capitalist; however, he remained the head of a vigorous propaganda effort to promote industrial equality, free education for children, and adequate living conditions in factory towns. In addition, he delivered lectures in Europe and published a weekly newspaper to gain support for his ideas.  In 1832 Owen opened the National Equitable Labour Exchange system, a time-based currency in which the exchange of goods was effected by means of labour notes; this system superseded the usual means of exchange and middlemen. The London exchange continued until 1833; a Birmingham branch operated for only a few months until July 1833. Owen also became involved in trade unionism. He briefly served as the leader of the Grand National Consolidated Trade Union (GNCTU) before its collapse in 1834.  Socialism first became current in British terminology in the discussions of the Association of all Classes of all Nations, which Owen formed in 1835 and served as its initial leader. Owen\\'s secular views also gained enough influence among the working classes to cause the Westminster Review to comment in 1839 that his principles were the actual creed of a great portion of them. However, by 1846, the only long-lasting result of Owen\\'s agitation for social change, carried on through public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals, and occasional treatises, remained the co-operative movement, and for a time even that seemed to have utterly collapsed.\\nQuestion: what notable person is in the article\\nAnswer: William Allen\\n\\nProblem: Background: Heaven Shall Burn are a German extreme metal band from Saalfeld, formed in 1996. The band consists of vocalist Marcus Bischoff, guitarists Maik Weichert and Alexander Dietz, bassist Eric Bischoff and drummer Christian Bass. They are currently signed to Century Media. They have released eight studio albums, as well as a number of other records.\\nContext: In January 2013, Heaven Shall Burn announced they had finished writing their next album and were about to start recording it. On February 20 they revealed their new album Veto, which was released April 19, in Germany and April 30, in North America. To promote the album\\'s release a music video was shot for \"Hunters Will Be Hunted\" and a lyric video was made for \"Godiva\". The release of the album was celebrated with shows at the Impericon Festivals in Leipzig and Vienna and the Loudfest in Zurich. Veto entered the official German Album Charts at #2. Heaven Shall Burn appeared on some European Summer Festivals in 2013, among these festivals were Graspop Metal Meeting and the first edition of Rock\\'n\\'Heim at the Hockenheimring. In support of Veto Heaven Shall burn embarked a headlining tour through Europe in November and December 2013, supporting acts were Hypocrisy, Dying Fetus and Bleed from Within. Before the tour began drummer Matthias Voigt released a statement and announced that he was about to step down as drummer of Heaven Shall Burn and live drummer Christian Bass would take his position.  In February 2014, Heaven Shall Burn toured South America with Parkway Drive. Heaven Shall Burn played several festivals across Europe in the Summer of 2014 including Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, Wacken Open Air, Deichbrand and Summer Breeze Open Air. Later the same year Heaven Shall Burn were special guest on Parkway Drive\\'s European Tour 2014, along with Carnifex and Northlane. Parkway Drive shared headlining duties with Heaven Shall Burn in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.  On April 30, 2015, Heaven Shall Burn became the sponsor for the tricots of football team FC Carl Zeiss Jena. It is part of their campaign \"Support Your Local Team\", which should encourage people to support their local clubs, not only top class clubs. May 3, was the first time Jena played in their new tricots.

       "    'content': 'Problem: Background: M. Bison, also known as Dictator, is a video game character created by Capcom. First introduced in Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, he is a recurring character and villain in the Street Fighter series of fighting games, acting as one of the series\\' primary antagonists. A would-be world dictator and megalomaniac, M. Bison\\'s ultimate ambition is to control the world\\'s governments through his covert crime syndicate, Shadaloo (shiyadoru, Shadoru, sometimes spelled as \"Shadoloo\", \"Shadowloo\" or \"Shadowlaw\"). He serves as the host of Street Fighter II\\'s fighting tournament and is the last opponent fought in the game.\\nContext: In Japan, the character is named Vega (bega, Bega), derived from the star of the same name. However, during localization of Street Fighter II for the English language market, Capcom\\'s North American branch felt that the name did not sound threatening enough to North American audiences for the game\\'s final boss, and thus was more suitable for the Spanish cage fighter Vega (Street Fighter). At this same time, another concern arose that the name of another character, Mike Bison, conceived as a parody of real-life boxer Mike Tyson, would be a legal liability for Capcom. As a result, the characters swapped names, and the game\\'s final boss was dubbed M. Bison for international appearances of the character. Though the \"M\" originally stood for \"Mike\" in Japan, Capcom has never explained what it stands for in Western releases, calling it \"part of the character\\'s mystery\". Regardless, Bison has been addressed as Master Bison in Street Fighter Alpha 3 repeatedly, as well as in the animated movie. In his introduction before a fight in (Super) Street Fighter IV, he refers to himself as \"The Mighty Bison\". In endings in Alpha 2, he is referred to by a henchman as Commander Bison. In Street Fighter V, he is referred to by F.A.N.G as Lord Bison.  When developing Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, it was decided to give him a more muscular appearance, rather than have him resemble \"a middle aged man\", while his face was modified to appear somewhat demonic. This appearance was later carried onto the Street Fighter Alpha series, featured as his original appearance before the Street Fighter II series.  The first source of inspiration for M. Bison\\'s design came from the character General Washizaki, one of the main villains of the popular martial arts manga Riki-Oh. However the final realized concept (especially the characters mysticism) is widely believed to be a homage to Yasunori Kato, the supernatural villain of the influential Teito Monogatari franchise.\\nQuestion: When did the conceptio of M. Bison start?\\nAnswer: In Japan, the character is named Vega (bega, Bega), derived from the star of the same name.\\n\\nProblem: Background: Architects are a British metalcore band from Brighton, East Sussex. The band currently consists of vocalist Sam Carter, drummer Dan Searle, bassist Alex Dean and guitarists Adam Christianson and Josh Middleton. The band\\'s first name was Inharmonic, which was swiftly changed to Counting the Days, and finally to Architects after a couple of years. They have released seven studio albums and one split EP with Dead Swans to date.\\nContext: Architects have been referred to as being \"pumped with both controlled rage and unhindered heart, accessible and ambitious, aggressive and beautiful\". Considered alongside Enter Shikari as offering metalcore style to more mainstream audiences they have been described as metalcore, technical metal and progressive metalcore. Their music is characterised by choppy, complex guitar riffs, the use of obscure time signatures and rhythmic breakdowns, and for their guitarists alternating between a \"down-tuned rumble\" and \"melodic punk\" during songs. However the band\\'s music isn\\'t solely based upon technical proficiency and does use catchy riffs and choruses.  Architects have made various stylistic transitions and evolutions throughout their career, with the band citing their belief that each album should be distinct. On their second album Ruin, the band\\'s sound was heavier and darker sound than on Nightmares. Hollow Crown maintains the aggression and technical proficiency of Ruin while incorporating more melody, catchy riffs and use of singing. The band also used synthesised instruments such as keyboards and drum machines. The guitars were tuned to Drop B with the lowest string at Ab, giving the \"ability to create a really heavy low end sound on the bottom but still give a comfortable degree of tension on the higher strings.\" A prime example of their signature style is the song \\'We\\'re All Alone\\', with its technical, progressive guitar riffs and heavy, hardcore punk-influenced rhythmic breakdowns.  Their fourth album \\'The Here and Now\\' represented a stylistic shift from their previous work considered \"ultimately subjective\" and \"their most diverse\". Described as going in a \"clean-cut post-hardcore\" direction, The Here and Now favours singing over screaming, anthemic choruses and hooks. The album still retains elements of their previous albums, however, including \"tortured howls, frenzied riffs, and earth-shattering rhythms, albeit with a slightly more mainstream edge.\" The album includes the melancholy, glitchy electronica-based \\'An Open Letter To Myself\\' and the rock ballad \\'Heartburn\\' both lead into \"rousing, fist-pumping choruses\".  The band\\'s fifth album Daybreaker featured something of a return to the heavier, more aggressive style of their previous albums, balancing this with the melody and hooks of The Here and Now. Daybreaker also features even more melodic, atmospheric tracks than usual, such as \\'Truth Be Told, \\'Behind The Throne\\' and \\'Unbeliever\\'.  After the release of Daybreaker the band grew confident in playing much heavier music again, and cited that the key influence on the heavier style of their sixth album was to create the best songs for live shows. The album also incorporates blastbeats, which have not been used in any of the band\\'s recordings since Hollow Crown.\\nQuestion: What are the musical influences of the band Architects?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

They are topographically divided into Western, Central and Eastern Sudetes. The Lower Silesian section of the Sudetes comprises the Jizera Mountains , where the tripoint with Upper Lusatia and Bohemia is located near the Smrk summit, along with the adjacent Karkonosze Krkonoše  ; Rudawy Janowickie ; Owl Mountains ; Stone Mountains ; Wałbrzych Mountains  and the Kaczawskie Mountains  with Ostrzyca, 501\\xa0m or 1,644\\xa0ft - they surround the Jelenia Góra valley, 420-450\\xa0m or 1,380-1,480\\xa0ft; Ślęża Massif , massive of Orlické hory, Králický Sněžník south of historical Kladsko Polish: Klodzsko), Rychlebské hory and Jeseníky   .\\n\\nQuestion: How many topographic areas are the Sudetes divided into?\\n\\n\\nInput: The incorporated city fit into 4-5 square miles  as late as the First World War, but has since greatly expanded, crossing the Ashley River and encompassing James Island and some of Johns Island. The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassing Daniel Island and the Cainhoy area. The present city has a total area of 127.5 square miles , of which 109.0 square miles  is land and 18.5 square miles  is covered by water. North Charleston blocks any expansion up the peninsula, and Mount Pleasant occupies the land directly east of the Cooper River. Charleston Harbor runs about 7 miles  southeast to the Atlantic with an average width of about 2 miles , surrounded on all sides except its entrance. Sullivan's Island lies to the north of the entrance and Morris Island to the south. The entrance itself is about 1 mile  wide; it was originally only 18 feet  deep, but began to be enlarged in the 1870s. The tidal rivers  are evidence of a submergent or drowned coastline. There is a submerged river delta off the mouth of the harbor and the Cooper River is deep.\\n\\nQuestion: How many miles wider is the average width of Charleston Harbor compared to the width of the entrance?\\n\\n\\nInput: Throughout 1476, supporters of Joanna from the nobility continued to submit to Isabella and Ferdinand, particularly those from the Pacheco-Girón lineage: Juan Téllez-Girón and his brother Rodrigo; Luis de Portocarrero; and, in September, the Marquis of Villena. In November 1476, Isabella's troops captured the castle of Toro. In the following months, they  took control of the last bordering localities controlled by the Portuguese and dealt with their adversaries in Extremadura. In July 1477, Isabella arrived in Seville, the most populous city of Castile, with the objective of asserting her power over the nobility of Andalusia. In April 1476, Isabella and Ferdinand gave their first exculpation to the Marquis of Cadiz. He had been regaining power while his rival, the Duke of Medina Sidonia, initially the main Isabella supporter in Andalusia, had been falling into dishonour. Through skilful negotiations, the Queen managed to take control of the main strongholds of Seville occupied by the Marquis and the Duke and, instead of returning them to their legitimate owners, named others as their heads. She prohibited both nobles from entering the city of Seville, under the pretext that their simultaneous presence there would risk violent conflicts. In this way the Duke's political dominance over Seville disappeared, and the city passed into the control of the Crown. One of the few nobles that refused to submit to the monarchs was Marshall Fernán Arias de Saavedra. Isabella's troops laid siege to his fortress at Utrera, and conquered it by assault in March 1478. The defeated suffered harsh repression. The first son of the monarchs, John of Aragon and Castile, was born in Seville on June 30, 1478, which opened new possibilities for dynastic stability of the Isabellian side.\\n\\nQuestion: What event happened first, Isabella arriving in Seville or Isabella and Ferdinand giving their first exculpation to the Marquis of Cadiz?\\n\\n\\nInput: The Chargers scored took a 10-0 lead, with quarterback Philip Rivers connecting on a 5-yard touchdown pass to tight end Hunter Henry, followed in the second quarter by a 37-yard field goal by placekicker Josh Lambo. Chargers' return specialist Travis Benjamin fumbled a punt return at the Chargers' 11-yard line, however, the Broncos did not gain any yardage, and were forced to settle for a 29-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus. Three third-quarter field goals by Lambo&#8212;from 21, 31 and 32 yards out&#8212;added to the Chargers' lead. The middle score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Jordan Taylor. McManus missed wide-right on a 56-yard field goal at the end of the third quarter. Early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos' defense forced a Chargers' punt that backed up the Broncos to their own 3-yard line. On the next play from scrimmage, Broncos' offensive tackle Russell Okung was penalized for holding in the end zone that resulted in a safety, extending the Chargers' lead to 21-3. On the ensuing free kick, the Chargers committed another special teams turnover, with guard Kenny Wiggins fumbling the kick near midfield. The Broncos capitalized on this turnover, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Trevor Siemian to wide receiver Bennie Fowler. The Broncos' defense forced a three-and-out on the Chargers' next possession with six minutes remaining in the game. On the sixth play of the Broncos' next drive, Siemian connected with running back C. J. Anderson on a 20-yard touchdown, however, another costly holding penalty on Okung negated the scoring play. Two plays later, Siemian connected on a pass completion to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas to the Chargers' 13-yard line, however, Chargers' linebacker Jatavis Brown forced a fumble off Thomas, which was recovered by cornerback Craig Mager, ending the drive with 3:35 remaining. The Broncos' defense forced another three-and-out, but used all three of their team timeouts in the process. A 46-yard field goal by McManus with 32 seconds remaining pulled the Broncos to within a 21-13 deficit. The Broncos recovered the onside kick at their own 46-yard line, however, four plays later, a desperation hail mary pass by Siemian fell short of the end zone. Special teams coordinator Joe DeCamillis served as interim head coach, while Gary Kubiak recovered from a migraine condition that he suffered during the previous week. As part of the NFL Color Rush program, the Broncos wore all-orange throwback uniforms. With the loss, the Broncos' NFL-record 15-game road winning streak against division opponents came to an end. This was the Broncos' final game in San Diego, as the Chargers relocated to Los Angeles after the 2016 season.\\n\\nQuestion:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Question: Daniel Barenboim (born 15 November 1942) is an Argentine-Israeli pianist and conductor who is a citizen of Argentina, Israel, Palestine, and Spain. He is the general music director of the Berlin State Opera, and the Staatskapelle Berlin; he previously served as Music Director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Orchestre de Paris and La Scala in Milan. Barenboim is known for his work with the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a Seville-based orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians, and as a resolute critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Barenboim has received many awards and prizes, including an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire, France\\'s Legion d\\'honneur both as a Commander and Grand Officier, and the German Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz and Willy Brandt Award.\\n\\nBarenboim has performed several times in the West Bank: at Bir Zeit University in 1999 and several times in Ramallah.  In December 2007, Barenboim and 20 musicians from England, the United States, France and Germany, and one Palestinian were scheduled to play a baroque music concert in Gaza. Although they had received authorization from Israeli authorities, the Palestinian was stopped at the Israel-Gaza border and told that he needed individual permission to enter. The group waited seven hours at the border, and then canceled the concert in solidarity. Barenboim commented: \"A baroque music concert in a Roman Catholic church in Gaza - as we all know - has nothing to do with security and would bring so much joy to people who live there in great difficulty.\"  In January 2008, after performing in Ramallah, Barenboim accepted honorary Palestinian citizenship, becoming the first Jewish Israeli citizen to be offered the status. Barenboim said he hoped it would serve as a public gesture of peace. Some Israelis criticized Barenboim\\'s decision to accept Palestinian citizenship. The parliamentary faction chairman of the Shas party demanded that Barenboim be stripped of his Israeli citizenship, but the Interior Minister told the media that \"the matter is not even up for discussion\".  In January 2009, Barenboim cancelled two concerts of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in Qatar and Cairo \"due to the escalating violence in Gaza and the resulting concerns for the musicians\\' safety.\"  In May 2011, Barenboim conducted the \"Orchestra for Gaza\" composed of volunteers from the Berlin Philharmonic, the Berlin Staatskapelle, the Orchestra of La Scala in Milan, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Orchestre de Paris--at al-Mathaf Cultural House. The concert, held in Gaza City, was co-ordinated in secret with the United Nations. The orchestra flew from Berlin to Vienna and from there to El Arish on a plane chartered by Barenboim, entering the Gaza Strip at the Egyptian Rafah Border Crossing. The musicians were escorted by a convoy of United Nations vehicles. The concert, the first performance by an international classical ensemble in the Strip, was attended by an invited audience of several hundred schoolchildren and NGO workers, who greeted Barenboim with applause. The orchestra played Mozart\\'s Eine kleine Nachtmusik and Symphony No. 40, also familiar to an Arab audience as the basis of one of the songs of the famous Arab singer Fairuz. In his speech, Barenboim said: \"Everyone has to understand that the Palestinian cause is a just cause therefore it can be only given justice if it is achieved without violence. Violence can only weaken the righteousness of the Palestinian cause\".\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Did Barenboim receive any awards or recognition?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer: \\nProblem: Graduel Christopher Darin Carter (born November 25, 1965) is a former American football player in the National Football League. He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles (1987-89), the Minnesota Vikings (1990-2001) and the Miami Dolphins (2002). After starting for the Ohio State University Buckeyes, Carter was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN\\'s Chris Berman\\'s famous quotes about Carter: \"All he does is catch touchdowns.\"\\n\\nCarter was one of the hosts of HBO\\'s Inside the NFL and is an NFL Analyst for Yahoo Sports and ESPN. He is also a faculty member and assistant coach at St. Thomas Aquinas High School, where his son played wide receiver in 2008. He is the owner of Cris Carter\\'s FAST Program, a sports training center in South Florida, and is an ordained minister. He also appeared in the 2005 sports video game NFL Street 2 as a wide receiver for the NFL Gridiron Legends team along with former teammate, safety Joey Browner, and a few other historical NFL legends.  He was a speaker at 2008 NFL rookie symposium and again at the 2009 NFL Rookie Symposium.  Carter also spoke at the 2014 NFL rookie symposium, where he encouraged players to get a fall guy they can trust to take the blame if they get in trouble. The comments were revealed in 2015 in an ESPN Magazine story about Chris Borland. The NFL took the video of the speech down from its website and released a statement saying in part: \"The comment was not representative of the message of the symposium or any other league program...The comment was not repeated in the 2014 AFC session or this year\\'s symposium.\" Carter apologized on Twitter saying he realized it was bad advice, and everyone should take responsibility for their own actions. ESPN also released a statement saying Carter\\'s comments do not reflect the company\\'s views.  Carter was chosen to be a coach for a team in the 2015 Pro Bowl, along with Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver, Michael Irvin.  On December 2016, Carter was hired by Fox Sports. He currently co-hosts with Nick Wright on First Things First.\\n\\nWhat did this mean for him\\n\\nAnswer with quotes:'},\n",

In May 1832, José Urrea, a rising officer, supported the restoration of President Pedraza. On July 20, Governor Elorriaga was reinstated, and Baca along with the legislative minority were brought back to form a new legislature, which met on September 1. Chihuahua showed no desire to imitate the revolutionary movement and Urrea prepared to invade the state. Comandante-general J.J.Calvo threatened to retaliate, and a conflict seemed imminent.

As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don\\'t worry if it\\'s not true—so long as there\\'s not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don\\'t check their facts or accept denials: they don\\'t care if the stories are true or not.\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher\\'s economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners\\' strike, and Thatcher\\'s refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher\\'s political opponents. Thatcher\\'s biographer John Campbell claimed \"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \"behind the scenes force\" in ending apartheid.\\nWho said the Elizabeth was a behind the scenes force in ending apartheid?\\n---\\nAnswer: Brian Mulroney\\n\\nQ: What is a question about this article?

In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the egg-laying industry. Poultry breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.\\n\\nAre there any purebreed lines for poultry today?\\n---\\nA:'},\n",

Over the following six years, the Intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation. More than a thousand people were killed in the violence. During the 1991 Gulf War, the PLO supported Saddam Hussein and Iraqi Scud missile attacks against Israel. Despite public outrage, Israel heeded US calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war.\\n\\nNow answer this question: How many people were killed in the violence?\\n\\nOutput: More than a thousand people\\nArticle: In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, \"Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition\". The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom.[citation needed] The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.[citation needed] Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, those who control the means of production (the economic base) essentially control a culture.[citation needed] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.), which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.[citation needed]\\n\\nQuestion: Which two wrote Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition?\\nAns: Lindlof and Taylor\\nHere is a question about this article: Callaghan had been widely expected to call a general election in the autumn of 1978 when most opinion polls showed Labour to have a narrow lead. However he decided to extend his wage restraint policy for another year hoping that the economy would be in a better shape for a 1979 election. But during the winter of 1978–79 there were widespread strikes among lorry drivers, railway workers, car workers and local government and hospital workers in favour of higher pay-rises that caused significant disruption to everyday life. These events came to be dubbed the \"Winter of Discontent\".\\nWhat is the answer to this question: Who were some of the people striking in 1978-1979?\\n****\\nSo... lorry drivers\\nThe problem: Answer a question about this article:\\nDell service and support brands include the Dell Solution Station (extended domestic support services, previously \"Dell on Call\"), Dell Support Center (extended support services abroad), Dell Business Support (a commercial service-contract that provides an industry-certified technician with a lower call-volume than in normal queues), Dell Everdream Desktop Management (\"Software as a Service\" remote-desktop management, originally a SaaS company founded by Elon Musk\\'s cousin, Lyndon Rive, which Dell bought in 2007), and Your Tech Team (a support-queue available to home users who purchased their systems either through Dell\\'s website or through Dell phone-centers).\\nWhat Dell service offers certified technicians to tackle commercial technical support?\\n****\\nThe answer: Dell Business Support\\nProblem: Please answer a question about the following article about Muslim world:\\nMuslim engineers in the Islamic world made a number of innovative industrial uses of hydropower, and early industrial uses of tidal power and wind power, fossil fuels such as petroleum, and early large factory complexes (tiraz in Arabic). The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. A variety of industrial mills were being employed in the Islamic world, including early fulling mills, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, tide mills and windmills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also invented crankshafts and water turbines, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Such advances made it possible for industrial tasks that were previously driven by manual labour in ancient times to be mechanized and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. The transfer of these technologies to medieval Europe had an influence on the Industrial Revolution.\\nWho was the inventor of water turbines?\\nA: Muslim engineers\\nQuestion: Read this and answer the question\\n\\nEvidence found in Chinese literature, and archaeological evidence, show that cartography existed in China before the Han.

However, the Broncos struck back, with Manning connecting on three touchdown passes to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas &#8212; an 11-yarder, a 7-yarder just before halftime and a 34-yarder on the opening possession of the second half, which increased the Broncos' lead to 28-6. On the Broncos' next possession, Chargers' linebacker Tourek Williams forced a fumble off Manning deep in Broncos' territory, and the Chargers immediately capitalized two plays later, with quarterback Philip Rivers throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to running back Danny Woodhead.

       "    'content': 'Q: This may sound easier said than done when you need to provide a fast answer on the spot.  However, you can calm yourself by using relaxation techniques, such as:   Take deep breaths.  You\\'ll slow your heart rate and move more oxygen to your brain. Repeat a positive and affirming message to yourself.  This could be as simple as \"I\\'ve got this.\"  If you often face situations that require quick thinking, you might prepare in advance so a specific phrase comes to mind.  Tense your muscles for a few seconds and then release.  The effort will help you concentrate.  Choose muscles that cannot be seen such as biceps or thigh muscles -- you don\\'t want to show stress to your questioner. . Ensure that you\\'re properly interpreting what the questioner is asking by looking directly at him or her and paying close attention to the question. Remove all distractions, such as by putting away your cell phone, turning off the TV, and closing your laptop. You can also study your questioner\\'s body language. As the person asks the question, focus on his or her eyes, facial expressions, and body positions. For example, if the person is making eye contact, smiling, and facing towards you, then these are all good indications that he or she is interested in what you have to say. However, keep in mind that facial expressions can be misleading. People are good at masking how they feel with their facial expressions. If you do not understand the question, then politely ask the questioner to repeat the question. It is important to make sure you fully understand what the person is asking. This will give you a little more time to think as well. Try saying something like, “Can you please repeat the question?” You can also repeat the question to yourself to make it easier to understand. Saying it out loud to yourself may help you to understand it better and it will also give you more time to come up with an answer. Don\\'t be afraid to ask clarifying questions.  If the question is unclear or uses unfamiliar jargon, a simple clarification could allow you to quickly and competently provide a response. Try saying something like, “Can you please explain what ___ means?” Or, “I don’t quite understand. Can you please rephrase the question?” Focusing on one point and one supporting piece of information will help target your initial response.  Avoid getting hung up on extraneous detail.  If your questioner wants to know more, he or she will ask a follow-up -- and meanwhile, you\\'ve demonstrated you can think fast and provide information quickly. For example, if your questioner asks, “How long have you worked in sales?” then your response should be brief. You might respond, “About eight years.” Don’t go into detail about all of the places you have worked in those eight years unless your questioner asks you to do so.\\nA: Relax your mind. Listen carefully to the question Ask to have the question repeated. Repeat the question yourself. Stick to the point.\\n\\nArticle: All-mountain boards are equally at home heading down the mountain and hitting jumps at the terrain park. They blend speed and maneuverability well, and are thus the perfect board for beginner riders or someone who wants to board downhill, half-pipes, or backcountry in the same day.   Size: If you stand the board up on it\\'s end, the top should reach between your nose and chin.  Directional Twin-Tip This hybrid shape can comfortably ride with either direction facing forward, but the front end is often tapered up slightly to make it faster downhill.  Camber Type: All-mountain boards usually come in camber shapes which curve upward. However, beginner riders should try a rocker-style because of the added maneuverability and turning forgiveness. Freestyle board are usually smaller so they don\\'t get in the way during tricks. They are highly maneuverable and light, but they have less speed and stability when going downhill. That said, they can still be used to to bomb down a mountain in a pinch.   Size: Since freestyle boards are usually smaller, choose one that feels comfortable to you. Stand the board up and look for something that reaches between your shoulder and chin.   Twin-tip: Freestyle riders will almost always want a twin-tip design, as this allows them to comfortably board in either direction after jumps or tricks.  Camber Type: Most freestyle riders prefer a \"camber\" shape, where the board curves slightly upward between the tips. This spring-loads the board to give you maximum pop on jumps. These boards are made to be quick and stable at high speeds. They are generally stiffer and have the bindings slightly set towards the back of the board.   Size: Usually the longest board type, a freestyle board will often reach near your forehead when stood on end.  Directional: All freeride boards are directional, meaning there is a designated front end to increase speed.  Camber Type: Freeride boards come in a variety of shapes, but one of the most common is a rocker/camber/rocker hybrid that curves down near the tips and up in the center. Powder boards are usually made for downhill riders who encounter a lot of fresh, soft snow. They have longer or tapered noses and raised ends to help stay on top of powder. The bindings are generally set towards the back of the board to keep the front end up.   Size: Generally longer to increase surface area and speed, since powder boards are not often used for tricks.  Directional: Most powder riders prefer directional boards, since the design allows them to sail smoothly over fresh snow.  Camber Type: Powder boards usually have a rocker-shape, which is when the entire board curves slightly upward. This keeps the tip and tail elevated so it doesn\\'t get caught in the deep powder.\\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\\nChoose an \"all-mountain board\" for beginners or riders who want a bit of everything. Choose a \"freestyle board\" if want to do a lot of tricks. Choose a \"freeride board\" if you do a lot of downhill riding. Choose a \"powder board\" to ride smoothly in fresh snow.\\n\\nQ: If you don’t want to have contact with the outside world, you’ll need to eliminate the reasons why people might want to contact you.

Bennett won an Emmy in 1982 for “A Woman Called Golda,” a miniseries about Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir starring Ingrid Bergman, the Times said.\\n\\nThe Chicago native who was born Harve Bennett Fischman got his start in radio, auditioning at age 10 for 1940s show “Quiz Kids,” which pitted child geniuses against one another. Bennett appeared on 212 episodes of the show before he turned 16, according to the Los Angeles Times.\\n\\nMost remember Bennett for his stewardship of the \"Star Trek\" films, which focused on three characters, “Khan” director Nicholas Meyer told the LA Times.\\n\\n\"Kirk was the leader and everyman,\" Meyer said, according to the LA Times. \"Spock represented logic and McCoy was the bleeding heart liberal. You put that troika together and it all works.\"\\n\\nBennett was also said to have convinced a reluctant Nimoy not to give up playing Spock, promising him “the greatest death scene since ‘Psycho,’” the LA Times reported.\\n\\nBennett’s wife, Jani, his daughters Samantha, Callie and Susan, and his son, Christopher, survive him, according to the LA Times.\\nWhat was this article about?\\nA:\\nThe “Star Trek” movies’ most celebrated producer passed away two days before Spock actor Leonard Nimoy died.\\nQ:\\nSir Philip Green questioned by MPs over BHS collapse - as it happened\\nThat was the longest and most confrontational parliamentary session I’ve covered over the last decade.\\n\\nSir Philip Green went into the grilling vowing to put his side of the story, and he took every opportunity to do so – interrupting MPs, refusing to answer questions he didn’t fancy, and taking criticism extremely badly.\\n\\nBroadly, his position is that some mistakes were made, but it’s not really his fault. He doesn’t want to blame anyone else, but managed to blame pretty much everyone who had a role in this fiasco - advisers, the pension regulator and even journalists.\\n\\nHe seemed particularly irked with City firms Olswang and Grant Thornton for representing Dominic Chappell, suggesting they provided a sheen of respectability.\\n\\nThat’s a pretty poor excuse for not realising that the ex-bankrupt racing driver might not be the best person to buy BHS.\\n\\nGreen did at least apologise, nice and early in the session, and admit he should never have sold the company to Chappell for £1.\\n\\nBut he also claimed that recent criticism was “wholly” unfair, and even blamed “envy and jealousy” for the dividends which moved from BHS to his luxury base in Monaco.\\n\\nGreen is entitled to his point of view, but perhaps he should save the lectures until the BHS pension deficit has been fixed.\\n\\nThe committee struggled to land many punches on Green over the financial details of the BHS farrago. That’s because the Arcadia chief had a two-pronged strategy; he either produced his own figures to challenge the MPs, or claimed he simply didn’t get involved with whatever they were asking about. For example, the sale of BHS’s Ealing store to his stepson.\\n\\nInstead, Green preferred to focus on other wrong-doing - such as Chappell’s apparent breach of the covenants set up to protect BHS.\\n\\nGreen did have the excuse that his wife, Lady Christina, actually owns Arcadia’s assets. Did the committee call the wrong Green? Perhaps Tina should sail one of the family’s yachts up the Thames and testify herself....\\n\\nBoom! Iain Wright just hinted that he will be calling Lady Tina Green for evidence on BHS corporate governance\\n\\nBHS pensioners did get one piece of good news - Green’s pledge to address the pension black hole. He said:\\n\\n“I want to give an assurance to the 20,000 [BHS] pensioners that I am there to sort this, in the correct way.”\\n\\nHowever, Green did not promise to ensure they would receive their full entitlement; instead, it might just be better than taking a cut in the Payment Protection Fund.\\n\\nGreen was also rather hazy about how the scheme fell into such a mess, insisting that he’d not bled the company dry but had actually invested capital in it.\\n\\nGreen’s aggressive attitude seemed to stun MPs at first; he slammed one member for excessive staring, and snarled “I can’t deal with this” when asked a pretty fair question about whether he’d deliberately offloaded BHS’s pension liabilities.\\n\\nAfter a while they began to suspect that it might hold the key to the crisis. The committee may well conclude that the BHS disaster might have been averted if Arcadia’s chairman had been more open to criticism. A corporate governance problem, indeed.\\n\\nGreen also showed that he’s not at the cutting edge of technology – we got a glimpse of his antiquated Nokia mobile phone, after he failed to turn it off following a break.\\n\\nSome younger viewers may have been baffled by the small booklet he waved at MPs at one stage; that’s called a cheque book, kids. And Green may well have to get it out again, and write a nine-figure sum to patch up the black hole in BHS’s pension.\\n\\nSource at one of pension authorities tells me the plan for BHS pension solution Green commissioned likely to cost him \"in excess\" of £275m.\\n\\nThat’s all from me today.

Their job is mainly about auditing the use of detonators - how many have been used, have the excess detonators been disposed off etc.\\nThis is something that has been happening for 40-plus years.\\nBut a typical quarry blast would only happen about twice a month.\\nIn a gold mine, explosives use is much more intense - blasting happens three or four times a week. Hence the police are saying it is a resource issue for them.\\nAccording to Galantas, the PSNI said it could only provide anti-terrorism cover for a two-hour period, two days a week.\\nThis would not be enough to sustain development or operation of the mine, said the company.\\nIt is now threatening to sue the PSNI saying it may seek \"substantial compensation for the costs of delays\".\\nRoland Phelps, the chief executive, said: \"The PSNI\\'s decision is clearly a blow to any proposed mine development in Northern Ireland and negatively affects the livelihoods of our employees and their families.\"\\nPSNI Ch Supt Kevin Dunwoody said the police must prioritise demands \"in a way that maximises the safety of the public and their officers and works to counter threats, to mitigate risk and to alleviate harm\".\\n\"Working with others to support their efforts for the development of enterprise and the economy is important to the PSNI,\" he added.\\n\"It is, however, reasonable to expect a commercial venture to contribute all or part of the policing costs where it is legitimate and proportionate to do so.\"\\nGalantas have emphasised they were willing to enter into a \"cost-recovery arrangement\" with the PSNI but were told there was no manpower available to provide the cover.\\n\\nSummarize the main points of that article.\\nAnswer:\\nA Canadian firm that wants to develop a mine near Omagh, County Tyrone, has said it has had to put its plans \"on hold\" and that jobs could be lost.\\n\\n\\nThe factories, owned by powerful landlords, are notorious for thriving on \"bonded labour\". Hundreds of thousands of people have remained locked in a cycle of debt and poverty for decades.\\nRights groups call it a form of modern-day slavery.\\nUntil last week, Sajjad Mesih and his wife Shama, a Christian couple in their 30s, worked at one such brick kiln.\\nFor years, they got up at dawn, laboured in harsh conditions through the day and finished up at dusk. That was their routine - every day, seven days a week. It was a life of debt and poverty that they hated.\\nOn Tuesday, they were lynched and burnt to death there by a mob on allegations of blasphemy.\\nBlasphemy is an explosive issue in Pakistan. Reporting of violence in the name of blasphemy is often self-censored, twisted and confused by misreporting.\\nPiecing together the sequence of events and what led to vicious crimes on the pretext of blasphemy is not always straightforward.\\nBut having visited the remote rural area and after speaking to up to a dozen or so people - including police, family, neighbours and eyewitnesses - here is an account of what the BBC has been able to put together.\\nIt all appears to have started about a week ago when the couple first heard about someone claiming to have discovered burnt pages of the Koran near their mud brick house.\\nSome extremist villagers were said to be furious and planning to take some kind of an action against the family.\\nShama\\'s sister Yasmeen knew more about the whispering campaign. Having converted to Islam along with her husband and children four years ago, she had good links inside the Muslim community.\\nIt was through Yasmeen that the couple was sent an ultimatum by angry villagers, says Shahbaz Masih, a close relative of the couple.\\nThey were told to convert to Islam to repent against their alleged sin or face the consequences for committing blasphemy.\\nShama and her husband Sajjad knew then that their lives were in serious danger.\\nThey had no intention of converting under duress. The only thing to do was to run for their lives.\\nOn Monday, the couple informed the factory bosses that they feared for their lives and desperately needed to leave.\\n\"Not without settling the debt you owe us,\" the couple was told by furious owners.\\nThey were then locked up in a room, in case they tried to escape without clearing their dues.\\nThere are suggestions that the amount of loan money they owed was $600 (Â£380); others say it was about $1,500 (Â£948).\\nThe next morning, before dawn, a group of extremist villagers went around the area to call on members of the public \"to come out for the defence of their great religion\".\\nClerics from local mosques used loud speakers to incite violence. Soon, hundreds of angry people converged on the brick kiln looking for the Christian couple.\\n\"They had blood in their eyes,\" says a young Christian man who watched the lynching from a safe distance. \"I was scared. No one could do anything to stop them.\"\\nA few policemen from the nearby check post soon arrived and tried to intervene. But they were outnumbered and beaten up by the mob and told to stay out of it.\\nThe crowd then dragged the pair out of the room, where they were held by the factory owner. They were attacked with bricks and shovels and later laid on the brick oven to be burnt alive.\\nAt the time of the murder Shama was expecting her fifth child, says her family.\\nThree lives were lost in the gruesome murders.\\nThe Christian community in the area is horrified by the public lynching.\\nIn the nearby Christian-majority town of Clarkabad, there is anger at the state\\'s failure to protect its vulnerable and at risk communities.\\n\"It could happen to anybody. Everyone here feels fearful,\" says Suleman Masih, a brick kiln worker.\\nFor its part, the government has appeared to move swiftly to try to reassure the beleaguered community. Scores have been arrested under the country\\'s tough anti-terror laws and the hunt is on for the remaining suspects.\\nBut given the culture of impunity around violence against minorities, many here are not convinced.\\n\"We want justice and until the culprits are held to account, Christians in Pakistan will not feel safe,\" says pastor Azmat Nadeem of the Church of Pakistan.\\nPakistan is a long way from changing or repealing its notorious blasphemy laws.\\nAt best, the only thing the country\\'s vulnerable and at risk communities can really hope for now is that the authorities will treat this case seriously and possibly deter similar gruesome crimes from happening again.\\n\\nSum:'},\n",

       "    'content': \"Summarize the following:\\nThe most effective way to simplify your packing is to use bags that fit the vacation. This doesn't necessarily mean the bag with the most space or the largest number of compartments. Weekend trips should suffice with a single tote or knapsack. Longer vacations should comprise a couple of suitcases, with at least one smaller bag included within the luggage itself. That way, you'll have something to carry around if you're going on walking trips once you've reached your destination.  Compression bags are specially designed to maximize the space therein. You might consider buying one if you travel a lot and have trouble packing the clothes you want into your current bags.  Try to make your luggage look visually unique. A lot of travellers have very similar-looking luggage, and something as simple as a brightly-coloured sticker will make yours stand out in a baggage carousel. Seasoned travellers may debate between neatly folding clothing into luggage, or rolling them up tightly. Neat folds will spare the inevitable creases, but rolling your clothing will save up on precious space, which is arguably more important when you'll need to be carrying everything around. Rolling socks together is especially helpful, as it helps keep pairs of socks together. Versatile items may be defined as things that fulfill more than one use. Something as basic as a roll of duct tape can be used to solve a number of potential problems you may come across. If you're travelling as a party, bring items that more than one of you will use, and share it. In this manner, you'll minimize the amount of stuff you need to bring, all the while maximizing the utility you're getting out of the stuff you do take with you.  Convertible clothing, like pants that can be converted into shorts,  is also recommended for this reason. Shoes are very space-consuming and only serve one purpose. Unless you are bringing multiple pairs of shoes for a specific purpose (such as attending a formal event) it's best to bring a casual pair of shoes and wear them throughout your vacation. Things like books and maps are very helpful to have on a vacation, but they're going to take up an inordinate amount of space in your luggage. Wherever possible, it's best to go digital. If you're planning on reading a lot during your vacation, an e-reader will let you bring hundreds of texts with you at a minimum of space cost. If you have a smartphone, you can use that in lieu of carrying maps and print manuals.  It's good to keep a credit card on you with at least a 1000 dollar limit in case you get into an emergency. However, you're best off keeping the local currency on you in order to save on potential transaction fees from your bank. Try to minimize the amount of devices you bring. Bringing a phone with movies and music saves you having to bring items specifically intended for those purposes.\\n\\nsummary: Use suitable bags or cases. Roll your clothes into rolls. Bring versatile and universal items. Go digital.\\n\\n\\nSummarize the following:\\nYour parents are probably afraid that if you try to become a singer, you’ll have a hard time succeeding and making money in the music industry. Listen to their points quietly and tell them that you understand how they feel. You could even thank them for having your best interests at heart. They’ll be impressed with your maturity and more likely to listen to your ideas now that you’ve heard theirs. Remember that your parents love you and want the best for you in life. They’re not trying to be mean--they’re just looking out for you. Tell them how much you’ve been practicing on your own and how you’ve been improving. Say, “I know I’m young right now, but I’ve found something I really love and that I want to do my whole life. It would mean so much to me if you supported me!” Try not to get to raise your voice or get too emotional. They’ll be more likely to listen to you and agree with your point of view if you stay calm and mature. Maybe your parents think you won’t focus as much on your grades if you take singing lessons, or that you’ll skip college to pursue your dream. Ask them what they’re specifically worried about and compromise.  For example, you could promise to bring your math grade up if your parents let you take singing lessons. You could promise to go to college and double-major in music and something more practical. Your parents will be relieved that you have backup options and that you’re still committed to other parts of your life. If you make a promise, keep it! If you promised to get a good GPA in exchange for getting singing lessons but you don’t bring your grades up, your parents might take your voice lessons away. If your parents become very angry or upset when you bring up your dream of singing, keep your plans to yourself. If you’re still living under your parents’ roof, you’ll have to go along with what they want, at least for now. Continue practicing on your own as much as you can. Tell yourself that this is actually good practice for you: you’ll probably face a lot of critics during your career as a singer. Keep your dream alive and don’t get discouraged! You won’t live with your parents forever. Eventually, you’ll be able to move out and follow your passion.\\n\\nsummary: Listen to their concerns. Explain to them that you’re serious about your dream. Strike a compromise. Continue without their support if you have to.\\n\\n\\nSummarize the following:\\nThe vinegar will be cloudy while it’s still warm, so it helps to cool it down.

       "    'content': 'Input: Read this: The links between religious and political life were vital to Rome\\'s internal governance, diplomacy and development from kingdom, to Republic and to Empire. Post-regal politics dispersed the civil and religious authority of the kings more or less equitably among the patrician elite: kingship was replaced by two annually elected consular offices. In the early Republic, as presumably in the regal era, plebeians were excluded from high religious and civil office, and could be punished for offenses against laws of which they had no knowledge. They resorted to strikes and violence to break the oppressive patrician monopolies of high office, public priesthood, and knowledge of civil and religious law. The senate appointed Camillus as dictator to handle the emergency; he negotiated a settlement, and sanctified it by the dedication of a temple to Concordia. The religious calendars and laws were eventually made public. Plebeian tribunes were appointed, with sacrosanct status and the right of veto in legislative debate. In principle, the augural and pontifical colleges were now open to plebeians. In reality, the patrician and to a lesser extent, plebeian nobility dominated religious and civil office throughout the Republican era and beyond.\\nQuestion: Who did the Senate select to settle a strike by the lower classes?\\n\\nOutput: Camillus\\n\\nQUES: In 1671, Robert Boyle discovered and described the reaction between iron filings and dilute acids, which results in the production of hydrogen gas. In 1766, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize hydrogen gas as a discrete substance, by naming the gas from a metal-acid reaction \"flammable air\". He speculated that \"flammable air\" was in fact identical to the hypothetical substance called \"phlogiston\" and further finding in 1781 that the gas produces water when burned. He is usually given credit for its discovery as an element. In 1783, Antoine Lavoisier gave the element the name hydrogen (from the Greek ὑδρο- hydro meaning \"water\" and -γενής genes meaning \"creator\") when he and Laplace reproduced Cavendish\\'s finding that water is produced when hydrogen is burned.\\n\\nWhat does gas produce when burned?\\nWhat is the answer?\\nANS: water\\n\\nQUES: Some Christian writers considered the possibility that pagan commentators may have mentioned this event, mistaking it for a solar eclipse - although this would have been impossible during the Passover, which takes place at the full moon. Christian traveller and historian Sextus Julius Africanus and Christian theologian Origen refer to Greek historian Phlegon, who lived in the 2nd century AD, as having written \"with regard to the eclipse in the time of Tiberius Caesar, in whose reign Jesus appears to have been crucified, and the great earthquakes which then took place\"\\nWhy was a solar eclipse impossible?\\n\\nANS: the full moon\\n\\nWhen paying a state visit to Britain, foreign heads of state are usually entertained by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. They are allocated a large suite of rooms known as the Belgian Suite, situated at the foot of the Minister\\'s Staircase, on the ground floor of the north-facing Garden Wing. The rooms of the suite are linked by narrow corridors, one of them is given extra height and perspective by saucer domes designed by Nash in the style of Soane. A second corridor in the suite has Gothic influenced cross over vaulting. The Belgian Rooms themselves were decorated in their present style and named after Prince Albert\\'s uncle Léopold I, first King of the Belgians. In 1936, the suite briefly became the private apartments of the palace when they were occupied by King Edward VIII.\\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): Where do foreign heads of stay at Buckingham Palace?\\nAh, so.. the Belgian Suite\\n\\nQuestion: The first Archivist, R.D.W.

I arrived at noon on a Sunday and the place was packed. They were serving large plates of pancakes, eggs and the like. It appears to be a very popular breakfast place.  I sat at the counter and ordered my gyro. The plate arrived and looked good. The gyro meat was pretty good, however the Tzatziki sauce was almost flavorless and the onion was too strong. Oh well, I gave it a shot. This is not the place to go for a gyro.    On a positive note, the fries were tasty.\\n\\n\\nQ: positive\\n\\nA: Awesome place to grab breakfast and lunch in Tempe.

Barley tea for everyone at the table.  Has a very traditional Korean feel, with the lighting of a Korean bar.  Service could be better, but I attribute that largely due to the language/culture barrier. They are quick to help, they just don't understand!

In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.\\n\\nQuestion: How long does the fermentation process take in brewing beer? \\nAns: a week to months\\nHere is a question about this article: The Tibetan Empire emerged in the 7th century, but with the fall of the empire the region soon divided into a variety of territories. The bulk of western and central Tibet (Ü-Tsang) was often at least nominally unified under a series of Tibetan governments in Lhasa, Shigatse, or nearby locations; these governments were at various times under Mongol and Chinese overlordship. The eastern regions of Kham and Amdo often maintained a more decentralized indigenous political structure, being divided among a number of small principalities and tribal groups, while also often falling more directly under Chinese rule after the Battle of Chamdo; most of this area was eventually incorporated into the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.

They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related films, The Arsenal Stadium Mystery (1939). The film centres on a friendly match between Arsenal and an amateur side, one of whose players is poisoned while playing. Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager George Allison was given a speaking part. More recently, the book Fever Pitch by Nick Hornby was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular. Published in 1992, it formed part of the revival and rehabilitation of football in British society during the 1990s. The book was twice adapted for the cinema – the 1997 British film focuses on Arsenal's 1988–89 title win, and a 2005 American version features a fan of baseball's Boston Red Sox.\\nWhat book by Nick Hornby has twice been adapted for film?\\nA: Fever Pitch\\nQuestion: Read this and answer the question\\n\\nEverything in between the far south and the far north is savannah (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees).

       "    'content': \"in: Brown pelicans with slit throat pouches have been washing up this month in south Florida, triggering community outcry as authorities investigate what they suspect are serial slashings. About 10 birds have died, and another four were injured, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The culprit apparently used a knife to slit the large gullets beneath their beaks, spokesman Robert Dube said. Throat slasher: 10 brown pelicans on the Florida Keys have died after having their pouches slashed. It comes just over a year after an almost identical attack on the Florida Keys which saw dozens of birds wash up dead on the shore. The birds use the oversized pouches to swallow fish skimmed from the water. Once slashed, they can starve to death. 'It's a slow, agonizing death for these animals,' Dube said. The maimed pelicans have been turning up around the lower Florida Keys, located in the southernmost part of the state. State wildlife officers are seeking tips about the slayings, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is also investigating. While no longer endangered, brown pelicans are protected by state regulations and the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Perpetrators can face fines and even jail time for harming the birds. Identical attack: Last year dozens of the birds were slain an injured by a serial throat slasher in Florida. Local residents have been offering reward money since officials issued an alert last week about the deaths. Wildlife officers suspect teenagers or irate fishermen could be behind the attacks. During winter months, the region also sees many part-time residents from northern states, Dube said. 'Right now we are at a loss,' he said. 'We love our critters down here in the Keys. It's caused a lot of concern.'\\nout: 10 birds killed and another four injured by throat slashing attack. Wildlife officers found the brown pelicans washed up in Florida Keys. Comes a year after identical attack, perpetrator was never identified.\\nin: A special undercover squad of Metropolitan Police officers tasked with infiltrating a range of left-wing organisations may have duped more than 100 women into having affairs. The Special Demonstration Squad which operated between 1968 and 2008 has been heavily criticised because officers attached to the unit had sexual relations with some of their targets. The Metropolitan Police has already paid out more than £400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child fathered by undercover officer Bob Lambert. Undercover police officer Bob Lambert, pictured, was tasked with infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front. While undercover during the 1980s, Lambert fathered a son with a woman while using the Bob Robinson alias. Lambert, who used the alias Bob Robinson, began a relationship with the woman, known only as Jacqui after he was tasked with infiltrating the Animal Liberation Front. The Metropolitan Police has confirmed that it deployed 147 SDS officers in undercover roles over a four-decade period. It is feared that compensation claims against the force could run into a mulit-million pound bill for damages and legal fees. According to a source who spoke to The Mirror: 'In nine out of ten cases we know about, SDS officers have had sexual relationships while undercover. There were nearly 150 of them, so it would not be unreasonable to suggest there are many more out there who don't realise they are victims.' Jacqui is reportedly to receive £425,000 and in an interview with the Guardian and the BBC, she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children. She said: ‘The legal case is finished but there is no closure for me. There is the money, but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong, there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers.’ ‘I don't know why I was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with Bob Lambert. ‘I don't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour I went through giving birth to our son. I feel violated.’ It is feared that undercover officers may have slept with more than 100 women over a 40-year period. In August four former SDS officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions. The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences. The Met was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘neither confirm nor deny’ (NCND) in response to the damages claims. As a result, the force confirmed Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers. Jules Carey, Jacqui's lawyer, told the Guardian and BBC that Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner, should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships. Undercover police officer Jim Boyling, also known as Jim Sutton was part of the covert surveillance squad. So far 12 woman have lodged cases against the Met over the actions of its undercover surveillance officers. Mr Carey told them: ‘The Metropolitan Police are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer, Bob Lambert. They are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself. ‘It is time for the commissioner of Metropolitan Police to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice’. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force ‘unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with Bob Lambert, an undercover officer, has had on this woman’ but said that it had ‘never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing’. He said: ‘We recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son. From the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity, completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances. We regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress. ‘We want to be, and have tried hard to be, as open as we possibly can. Arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing, but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic.'\\nout:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Question: Bocelli was born to Alessandro and Edi Bocelli. Doctors had advised Bocelli\\'s parents to abort Bocelli before birth as they predicted, based on studies, that Bocelli would be born with a disability. It was evident at birth that Bocelli had numerous problems with his sight, and after visits to many doctors, he was diagnosed with congenital glaucoma. Bocelli has stated that his mother\\'s decision to give birth to him and overrule the doctor\\'s advice was the inspiration for him to oppose abortion.\\n\\nBocelli met his first wife, Enrica Cenzatti, while singing at piano bars early in his career. They were married on 27 June 1992, and had two children. Their first child, Amos, was born in February 1995. Their second son, Matteo, was born in October 1997. The couple separated in 2002. Bocelli lives with his second wife and manager, Veronica Berti. They met in 2002. In September 2011, the couple announced that Berti was expecting her first and Bocelli\\'s third child, a daughter, in the spring. Virginia, Bocelli\\'s first daughter, was born 21 March 2012. The couple live in a spacious villa in Forte dei Marmi on the Mediterranean. Bocelli\\'s first wife and two sons live in the couple\\'s previous residence in the same comune, in Versilia. Andrea married Veronica Berti on 21 March 2014 at the Sanctuary of Montenero in the coastal town of Livorno, Italy.  On 30 April 2000, Bocelli\\'s father, Alessandro Bocelli, died. His mother encouraged him to honor his commitments, and so he sang for Pope John Paul II, in Rome, on 1 May, and immediately returned home for the funeral. At his 5 July performance, filmed for PBS as American Dream--Andrea Bocelli\\'s Statue of Liberty Concert, Bocelli dedicated the encore Sogno (Dream), from his 1999 album Sogno, to the memory of his father.  A section of the beach in Jesolo, on the Italian Adriatic coast, was named after Bocelli on 11 August 2003.  In October 2013 Bocelli bought a second home in North Miami Beach.  Bocelli is a self declared passionate fan of Italian football club Inter Milan. In an interview in Pisa, he claimed to a group of Inter fans that \"My passion for Inter started during my college years, when Inter was winning everything in Italy and the world. When Inter won the Champions League in 2010, I was with my friends and I was listening the game on the radio, and everything was a little bit in advance so I was celebrating before them. That night I was also brought to tears of joy. The treble is a feeling no one in Italy will be able to equal\".\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Does he have any children?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer: Bocelli\\'s first daughter, was born 21 March 2012.\\n\\n\\nQuestion: Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [ka:l \\'nelsn]; 9 June 1865 - 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country\\'s most prominent composer. Brought up by poor but musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886.\\n\\nWhile travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner\\'s music dramas, heard many of Europe\\'s leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark\\'s English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \"love match\", but also a \"meeting of minds\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\". This determination would strain the Nielsens\\' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.  Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \"psychological\" period. Fanning writes, \"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Sovnen\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer\\'s life.  Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie. In 1912, an illegitimate daughter was born - Rachel Siegmann, about whom Anne Marie never learned. With his wife Nielsen had two daughters and a son. Irmelin, the elder daughter, studied music theory with her father and in December 1919 married Eggert Moller (1893-1978), a medical doctor who became a professor at the University of Copenhagen and director of the polyclinic at the National Hospital. The younger daughter Anne Marie, who graduated from the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, married the Hungarian violinist Emil Telmanyi (1892-1988) in 1918; he contributed to the promotion of Nielsen\\'s music, both as a violinist and a conductor. Nielsen\\'s son, Hans Borge, was handicapped as a result of meningitis and spent most of his life away from the family. He died near Kolding in 1956.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What were the names of the two illegitimate children?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer:'},\n",

She's now set up a website to help larger ladies start running and remove stigma.\\nOutput: Julie Creffield is on a quest to prove that slim doesn't necessarily mean fit - and fat doesn't always equate to being unhealthy. Weighing 15st 7lb, Julie runs 5-10km four times a week, incorporating a longer run at weekends when training for a marathon. She's set up a website, 'The Fat Girls’ Guide to Running’, to help others to start running, whatever their size. Julie, pictured after completing a marathon, now regularly runs 10k  four or more times each week. Julie set up The Fat Girls' Guide to Running website which gives tips on how to start running if you are larger. Julie spoke to MailOnline about her mission to prove you don’t have to be slim to be fit. At age 23 and weighing 20st Julie, from Stratford, was unfit and living on diet of fast food, with a very active social life which saw her binge drinking several times a week. Working on the Olympic project, Julie felt she needed to make an effort with her health. ‘A a work colleague convinced me to take part in a 3k fun run. With absolutely no training, I almost died on the way round - not only due to the unusual strain on my body, but also from pure embarrassment when a young boy shouted “Run Fatty Run” as I passed him. ‘That shocked me into taking action and regaining control over my life. The following day I signed up for the London Triathlon, which I completed just three months later in a XL wetsuit that just about fitted my size 18 body.’ Despite this, Julie admits she made little real progress over the following six years, taking part in fitness events sporadically, with her party lifestyle and unhealthy diet preventing her from making any real strides in fitness or weight loss. At first, Julie's party lifestyle and unhealthy diet prevented her from making any real strides in fitness. It was a comment by a rude spectator ('Run, fatty, run') during a 3k fun run that sparked Julie's campaign to prove bigger women can - and should - run. Julie, who gave birth to her daughter in January last year, has now changed her diet and is working with a nutritionist to make sure she gets the proper sustenance for training. However she insists weight loss is in no way a goal. ‘I rarely drink alcohol now and my diet is much more balanced. I eat more proper foods and I’ve stopped eating ‘diet’ foods. ‘I cook much more food from scratch and snack more healthy on things like fruit and nuts. ‘Now I’m a mother I didn’t want to pass on unhealthy habits to my daughter. Julie's blog about running as a larger lady received thousands of hits, so set up her website 'The Fat Girls' Guide to Running' ‘I also want to be a good role model for people. I don’t want to say you can eat literally whatever you want as long as you exercise and be healthy because that isn’t the case. ‘Obesity is a huge concern around the world, but inactivity is the big killer of our time. Many people simply think that running is something that fat women can’t or shouldn’t do at all, including some medical professionals - I am on a mission to prove otherwise.’ Julie set up The Fat Girls’ Guide to Running website which gives tips on how to start running if you are larger or a mother, as well as nutrition tips, events as well as running campaigns such as ‘Kit that Fits’ which encourages companies to make workout clothes available in larger sizes. Julie says: ‘ The blog was going on in the background telling my story and I started to get people coming to me asking for advice. ‘It was getting upwards of 10,000 hits and I started to think, this is something I am really passionate about and I could do it full time.’ The website, which advocates the Health at Every Size approach or HAES, states: ‘Being overweight in this modern world is not an easy thing what with the Medias obsession with an unachievable idea of “The Perfect Body” the pressure to be a certain size and to live a healthy lifestyle has never been stronger. Julie now runs day-long retreats for women where, as well as running, they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active. ‘But we all know that slim does not equal fit, and fat does not always equate to being unhealthy, or inactive, or lazy, or… all of those other negative connotations that it has acquired over the years. ‘HAES isn’t suggesting that everyone of every size is always healthy – a popular misconception. Instead, it focuses on helping anyone interested in being as healthy as they can be in the body they have right now. Hand in hand with this it challenges size stigma to advance equality.’ Julie hopes to continue to expand the website, and now runs day long retreats for women where, as well as running, they have sessions on confidence and what keeps them from being active.\\n\\nInput: Breathtaking images captured by photographer Hans Strand, 57, on journey through Greenland, Iceland and Norway.

These remarkable pictures show water crashing from a melting glacier 160 feet into the ocean at the Arctic Circle. Tiny seagulls flitting around the frozen landscape and fishermen's trawlers dwarfed by gigantic icebergs emphasise the awe-inspiring scale of the scene. The images were captured by Swedish photographer Hans Strand, 57, who took his life in his hands by exploring the extreme climate of the inhospitable north on a small ship. Ice sculpture: The frozen water forms unique shapes on the water in Svalbard, as brave photographer Hans Strand sails past on his tiny ship. Hostile climate: The Austfonna glacier waterfall in Svalbard, Norway, crashes 160 feet into the ocean in this awe-inspiring image. Big Freeze: Two seagulls fly past the Norwegian glacier, left, and fishermen steer their boat close to a giant iceberg in Disko Bay, Greenland, right. Dark waters: Mr Strand says dramatic climate change is happening so fast he sees significant differences in and around Iceland, pictured, from year-to-year. Epic scale: An imposing panorama of an ice-fjord floating along the bone-chilling water in Svalbard. 'These pictures show sculptures made of ice and frozen time,' said Mr Strand. 'The ice in the glaciers and floating icebergs can be more than 100,000 years old. 'But nature is unpredictable and shooting inside an ice cave is of course extremely dangerous. 'I was almost killed once by a collapsing ice. 'However, this ice cave looked pretty stable, so I took a chance and worked fast when I was inside.' Mr Strand covered more than 1,000 miles of ocean around Svalbard in Norway on a ship called the MS. Origo and took the incredible pictures at Austfonna glacier. Crystalline: Blue icebergs lie languidly on the water in these gorgeous photos of Norway as the gigantic glacier melts away. Chill wind: Mr Strand, 57, covered more than 1,000 miles of ocean to take breathtaking pictures including this one from Greenland. Tunnel vision: The open shaft of an ice cave grown over thousands of years, left, and craggy rocks jutting out of the sea, right, in Iceland. Cold climate: Clouds roll across a brooding sky above Smeerenburg Fjord in Norway in this magnificent picture. He hired the ship especially for a photographic workshop he was delivering to his students - taking further beautiful pictures during an expedition in Iceland and Greenland. 'I travelled to these northern latitudes because I am currently working on a book on the Arctic and I am also teaching workshops,' said Mr Strand. 'When I first went to Svalbard in 2004 there was plenty of sea ice around the islands during the summer. 'Today, eight years later, there is not a single ice floe - dramatic climate change is happening so fast that I have seen significant differences from year-to-year. 'Now you need to go as far north as the 82nd latitude to find sea ice.' Frozen in time: Splendid 150-foot tall Fuglefjorden glaciers rear out of the water in Svalbard in this alien landscape. End of the earth: Icebergs split and float along the water at sunset in Disko Bay, on the west coast of Greenland. Dangerous: The interior of a cave in Iceland, which could have collapsed in on Mr Strand at any moment.\"}]},\n",

Around 6 weeks prior to the first frost, usually mid-fall, is the best time to plant. Although this is not essential, it will increase the tree\\'s chances of survival. Planting trees outside of the dormancy period can place them under unnecessary stress. Particularly in the spring, when providing them with the amount of water necessary for growth is difficult. Tap the container on the outside the loosen the edges of the soil. Carefully slide your tree from the container, taking care to keep the soil around the roots intact and prevent the separation of roots from the tree. If your tree becomes root-bound, use a knife to cut an \"X\" along the root ball\\'s bottom. Follow this by making four cuts vertically along the root ball\\'s sides. Use a measuring tape to get a rough idea of how big the root ball is in terms of length and height. Afterwards, return the plant to the container or set it aside until you\\'re ready to plant. Use a shovel to dig a hole that\\'s about twice the size of the root bundle to accommodate the plant\\'s growing root system. Use a garden fork to loosen the sides of the hole, but not so much that the sides begin to collapse. Put on gardening gloves and remove any weeds that you see. You can use a trowel or knife to loosen the soil around the weeds and cut into their roots to prevent them from growing back.  Place your grass and weeds into a bucket to prevent them from spreading seeds. Sprinkling salt onto the bottom of weed plants can help kill them over time. Gently brush off soil around the root balls. Avoid damaging the roots, as this will cause the plant stress during transplanting. You\\'re always going to damage some roots even if you\\'re careful. Just try to minimize damage as much as possible. Use a tiller to loosen the soil in a 6 feet (72\\xa0in) diameter around the hole location. This will ensure that your plant\\'s roots have enough space to spread out.  Adding organic matter like peat moss, compost, or leaf mold can help loosen the soil. Improper root growth is one of the main causes of Leyland Cypress death. When placing your tree into the hole, make sure that the top of the root bundle will be approximately 0.25 inches (0.64\\xa0cm) below the ground surface. Firmly pack scoops of topsoil around the roots until they are covered and the plant\\'s crown is right above the soil line. Good quality topsoil will provide the right combination of nutrients for healthy plant growth and proper water retention. Always water immediately after planting while the soil is loose. Press the soil down gently after watering to circulate the water through the soil. Giving your freshly planted tree fertilizer is a great boost. Afterwards, don\\'t fertilize it until 3 months following planting. Fertilizing earlier will promote the growth of the top at the expense of root system growth.  Use an 8, 9, 12, or 14-month slow-release fertilizer. Avoid fertilizers high in nitrogen until the tree has developed a proper root system that can support increased top growth.  Root system growth is essential for long-term survival. Place 3 to 4 metal or wooden stakes around the base of the tree approximately 2 feet (24\\xa0in) away and tie each of them to the tree using string. Securing your tree to stakes keeps it from bending in the wind.\\nA: Plant Leyland Cypress trees when they are dormant. Remove the Leyland Cypress plant from its original container. Assess the plant\\'s root bundle to determine the size of its hole. Dig a hole approximately twice the size of the plant\\'s root bundle. Pull up any grass and weeds in and around the hole. Use your hands to loosen the soil around the roots. Loosen the soil in the region around your planting location with a tiller. Place the plant into the hole. Pack topsoil around the roots firmly. Water the tree until the soil is moist to the touch. Apply starter fertilizer at the time of planting. Stake the tree to secure it from bending in the wind.\\n\\nArticle: Create a thick paste and apply onto yellowed areas. Be sure to get the paste on every part of the stain.  Baking soda can be used to clean any bra: white, solid colored, or patterned. It is a mild abrasive so would be great for textured fabric. Baking soda also helps remove odors from clothing, so this may be the best method if your bras are retaining an unpleasant scent along with the stains. This gives the baking soda time to remove the stain. Sunlight will also help the solution work. Be gentle, as you don\\'t want to ruin the fabric. Removing the paste before laundering will keep your washing machine or sink from getting gunked up. Laundering will remove the rest of the paste and leave your bra smelling fresh. Do not wring out the bra, but gently press the water out of it. Try gently rolling the bra in a clean towel to remove the excess water. The sun is an excellent bleaching agent, so this will help remove any lingering stains. Using a dryer to dry your bras can damage the fabric, including the elastic and underwire,  and leave your bras misshapen.\\nQuestion: What is a summary of what this article is about?\\n'},\n",

Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker Joe Nedney got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back Frank Gore getting a 79-yard touchdown run. The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker Olindo Mare made a 36-yard field goal. San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback Matt Hasselbeck received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup Seneca Wallace completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back Julius Jones. In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run. San Francisco would close the game out in the fourth quarter as Nedney nailed a 39-yard field goal.\\n\\nWhich player scored at least three field goals?\\nA: Joe Nedney\\n\\n\\nQ: The Ravens began their 2007 campaign on the road against their AFC North foe, the Cincinnati Bengals, in the first game of a Monday Night Football doubleheader.  In the first quarter, Baltimore lost two fumbles early on, with the Bengals turning the second fumble into QB Carson Palmer's 39-yard TD pass to WR Chad Johnson.  Later, another Raven fumble allowed Cincinnati to cash in as Bengals kicker Shayne Graham nailed a 23-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Baltimore finally managed to get on the board as RB Musa Smith got a 6-yard TD run.  Later, Cincinnati increased its advantage with Graham kicking a 40-yard field goal.  The Ravens would end the half with kicker Matt Stover getting a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Baltimore's turnover problems continued as QB Steve McNair fumbled the ball as he got sacked, allowing Bengals LB Landon Johnson to return the fumble 34 yards for a touchdown for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Ravens finally took the lead with Stover kicking a 23-yard field goal and Safety Ed Reed returning a punt 63 yards for a touchdown.  However, later in the period, a McNair pass would end up intercepted by DE Robert Geathers.  The Bengals would quickly cash in as Palmer would complete a 7-yard TD pass to WR T. J. Houshmandzadeh, followed by a 2-point conversion run by RB Rudi Johnson.  With McNair having groin problems, QB Kyle Boller would take over.  He threw a pass in the red zone to tight end Todd Heap that was overturned for an offensive pass interference penalty - a call that drew anger from Ravens fans as replays showed that if anything, Heap had been interfered against. Near the end of the game, he almost helped the Ravens score, but a Michael Myers interception ended any hope of Baltimore's comeback.  In the end, the Ravens would end up with 6 total turnovers on the night. With the loss, Baltimore began its season at 0-1 while the Bengals started out 1-0.

Meanwhile, the Vikings were without six members of their regular starting offense, including QB Brett Favre and RB Adrian Peterson. The Rams got the first touchdown of the game with 1:29 remaining in the first quarter, when Danny Amendola returned a Chris Kluwe punt for 93 yards. The Vikings responded with two TDs in the second quarter; first, backup QB Sage Rosenfels passed for two yards to wide receiver Logan Payne, before throwing a 65-yard TD pass to tight end Garrett Mills. Rosenfels got his third passing TD in the third quarter, with a 71-yard pass to WR Marko Mitchell.

The lead up to the war began with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 which was met with immediate economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iraq. The coalition commenced hostilities in January 1991, resulting in a decisive victory for the U.S. led coalition forces, which drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait with minimal coalition deaths. Despite the low death toll, over 180,000 US veterans would later be classified as \"permanently disabled\" according to the US Department of Veterans Affairs (see Gulf War Syndrome). The main battles were aerial and ground combat within Iraq, Kuwait and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia.

Examples of such professional groups include Straight No Chaser, Pentatonix, The House Jacks, Rockapella, Mosaic, and M-pact. There also remains a strong a cappella presence within Christian music, as some denominations purposefully do not use instruments during worship. Examples of such groups are Take 6, Glad and Acappella.

Matches are necessary in order to chat, so make sure you take the time to craft a quality profile and start sifting through your potential matches.  See this guide for detailed instructions for installing the app and creating a solid profile. Tinder is available for free for both iOS and Android, and requires a Facebook profile. You should be using all of the available photo slots for various pictures of yourself. Ensure that you aren\\'t posting any pictures of you with a member of the opposite sex, that you aren\\'t in a picture with a child, or that they aren\\'t all group photos. Make sure you\\'re smiling! You can chat with anyone that you\\'ve \"Liked\" who has also \"Liked\" you back. Open the Matches menu and tap on one of your matches to open a chat window.  Wait about a day after the match is made before you strike up a conversation. Take the initiative with the conversation. It shows confidence and a willingness to take control. Don\\'t be discouraged if you don\\'t get a reply. Not everyone will respond to your messages. Brush yourself off and try again with your next match. . Avoid a simple \"Hi\" or \"Hello\", as this is sure to turn off the majority of people you\\'re chatting with. Look closely at the other person\\'s profile photos and bio to glean any interests. For example, if you see a guy with a surfboard, ask about his favorite surfing spots. Make sure your grammar and spelling is correct all the time, especially in the beginning of your conversation. Remember, first impressions last! Ask simple questions to learn more about the person you\\'re talking to. What are his/her hobbies, interests, etc.?  Avoid asking questions that are too personal. Keep your approach casual. Talk like you’re talking to a friend that you\\'ve known for a long time. Stay calm and keep your cool.\\n\\nSummary: Install Tinder and make some matches.

Get creative with your opening lines Ask questions.\\n\\n\\nUse the handle of a rat-tail comb to separate a thin strand of hair from the middle section. Pull it taut so that it is perpendicular to your head. Select a strand that is no larger than the diameter of the perm rod you plan to use, since packing too much hair onto a rod can result in limp curls. You can start at your front hairline or at the back of your crown. If you did the latter, you’ll have to go back and do the front once you reach your nape. Place an end paper against the hair strand, so that half of it is hanging off the side. Fold the excess paper under the hair strand so that it\\'s sandwiched inside. Next, slide the end paper towards the bottom of the hair section. It would be a good idea to fold some end papers in half ahead of time. This way, you can just slide it over the edge of the hair strand, then pull it down. Place the end of the hair strand on top of a curling rod. Wrap the hair around the curling rod until you reach your scalp, then close the rod.  Choose a rod size that’s appropriate for the curl size you want. Remember: the larger the rod, the larger and looser the curl. Roll the rod downward, away from your forehead and towards your nape. If you started from the back of your crown, work your way down to your nape first, then go back and do the front section. If you started from your hairline, just work your way down to your nape. Make sure that all of the hair from the middle section goes into the rod. Choose a side to start with, and unravel the run. Create a vertical part, somewhere behind your ear, and wrap the front section of hair into a bun. Apply more rods horizontally in a vertical column, then do the front section of hair (the one that’s in front of your ears).  The ends of the rods need to be touching each other--including the side-back section and the middle section. Start applying the rods at the top of the side section, right under the middle section, and finish at your hairline. At this point, your hair may start to dry as you work with it. If that happens, simply mist it with water. This will make it easier to wrap around the rod. This is very important, as you’ll need some sort of barrier between your skin and the perm solution. Purchase a strip of cotton batting from an online or local beauty supply store, then wrap it around your hairline, tucking it under the edges of the rods. The cotton batting is not fabric. It looks like a long cotton ball. It’s similar to what you’d find at a nail salon.\\n\\nSummary: Take a thin strand of hair from the middle section. Fold an end paper around the end of the hair strand. Wrap the hair strand around a curling rod. Repeat the process for the entire middle section. Apply 2 columns of rods to each side section. Wrap a cotton strip around your hairline, tucking it under the rods.\\n\\n\\nPlace the tip of your wood glue at the edge of your inner label, and squeeze the bottle with light pressure. As the record spins, continue squeezing out the glue so it creates lines around your record. Stop when you reach the outer edge. You should have thin, even lines over all of your record.  Your record will have stripes of glue following the circular grooves of the vinyl. If you squeeze out too much glue on the vinyl, that\\'s okay. You will even out the amount of glue. However, if you use too much towards the outer edge, use a paper towel to wipe up the excess. If you are worried about getting glue on your turntable, you can apply the glue to the record on a table instead. The spinning of the turntable helps spread the glue across your record. Take a piece of cardboard or cardstock about 2 inches (51\\xa0mm) wide, and touch it to the outer edge of your record. Let your record continue to spin, and the glue will spread out and cover the record as it moves. Then, lift up on your card and place it at the inside of your record to spread out all of the glue.  You can leave your hand stationary and let the spin of the record spread the glue for you. You will have a smooth, even surface of wood glue covering the entirety of your record. You can leave your record on your turntable overnight. To see if the wood glue is dry, you can gently touch the outer edge of the glue with your finger. If it still feels sticky, let it sit for 1-2 more hours and try again. You can also leave your record on a piece of newspaper to dry if you do not use a turntable. Using your index finger and your thumb, pull up on the outer edge of the wood glue. Then, lift up with steady, consistent force to peel away all of the glue. Remove the glue slowly and gradually to try to pull it up in 1 piece.  If your wood glue does not peel in 1 solid layer, that’s okay! Lift up at another edge and peel away the glue until it is completely removed. Avoid touching the surface of your record as you peel away the glue. Put the arm of your turntable onto your record and power it on. Listen to your record, and the part of the song that used to skip may play clearly now. Wood glue can help your vinyl by capturing even the toughest dirt and dust.  Keep in mind that using wood glue does not guarantee your record will be fixed. The wood glue provides a thorough clean of the entire record by removing any dirt and debris and smoothing over uneven vinyl surfaces. If your record still skips, try another coat of wood glue or another vinyl cleaning method. You could also search online for a professional vinyl restorer near you.\\n\\n'},\n",

These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism\\'s verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel\\'s examples fall under this category. For instance, atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature.\\n\\nWho wrote the book Science Versus Crime which challenged the logic of falsificationism?\\nOutput: Houck\\nInput: Article: Since the early days of rail transport in the United States, Philadelphia has served as hub for several major rail companies, particularly the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad first operated Broad Street Station, then 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, and the Reading Railroad operated out of Reading Terminal, now part of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The two companies also operated competing commuter rail systems in the area, known collectively as the Regional Rail system. The two systems today, for the most part still intact but now connected, operate as a single system under the control of the SEPTA, the regional transit authority. Additionally, the PATCO Speedline subway system and NJ Transit\\'s Atlantic City Line operate successor services to southern New Jersey.\\n\\nNow answer this question: Name 2 rail companies that use the city as a hub?\\n\\nOutput: Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Railroad\\nArticle: Charleston annually hosts Spoleto Festival USA founded by Gian Carlo Menotti, a 17-day art festival featuring over 100 performances by individual artists in a variety of disciplines.

In England the two phases might be characterized first by the structures of Robert Adam, the second by those of Sir John Soane. The interior style in France was initially a Parisian style, the \"Goût grec\" (\"Greek style\") not a court style. Only when the young king acceded to the throne in 1771 did Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, bring the \"Louis XVI\" style to court.\\nWhat is the answer to this question: What architect typifies the first style of neoclassical in England?\\n****\\nSo...

One of the most widely used definitions defines it in terms of the variability within species, between species, and between ecosystems. It is a measure of the variety of organisms present in different ecosystems. This can refer to genetic variation, ecosystem variation, or species variation (number of species) within an area, biome, or planet. Terrestrial biodiversity tends to be greater near the equator, which seems to be the result of the warm climate and high primary productivity. Biodiversity is not distributed evenly on Earth. It is richest in the tropics. Marine biodiversity tends to be highest along coasts in the Western Pacific, where sea surface temperature is highest and in the mid-latitudinal band in all oceans. There are latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity generally tends to cluster in hotspots, and has been increasing through time, but will be likely to slow in the future.\\nWhere is sea surface temperature the highest?\\n****\\nThe answer: along coasts in the Western Pacific\\nThe problem: Answer a question about this article:\\nThe poor performance of the Portuguese economy was explored in April 2007 by The Economist, which described Portugal as \"a new sick man of Europe\".

By way of illustration, Whitehead uses the example of a person\\'s encounter with a chair. An ordinary person looks up, sees a colored shape, and immediately infers that it is a chair. However, an artist, Whitehead supposes, \"might not have jumped to the notion of a chair\", but instead \"might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape.\" This is not the normal human reaction; most people place objects in categories by habit and instinct, without even thinking about it. Moreover, animals do the same thing. Using the same example, Whitehead points out that a dog \"would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such.\" In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other, and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality (as the dog illustrates), while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality (as the artist illustrates).\\n\\n How might an artist view a chair the same as a typical person?\\nWhat is the answer?\\nANS: unanswerable\\n\\nQUES: The Legislature is composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House, led by a speaker, has 73 members apportioned among the 15 counties on the basis of the national census, with each county receiving a minimum of two members. Each House member represents an electoral district within a county as drawn by the National Elections Commission and is elected by a plurality of the popular vote of their district into a six-year term. The Senate is made up of two senators from each county for a total of 30 senators. Senators serve nine-year terms and are elected at-large by a plurality of the popular vote.

However, planning for the next encounter was more based upon the reality of unfolding events rather than emotion or pride, as Intendant General Wolff told him and his staff that supply beyond the Saar would be impossible. Therefore, the armies of France would take up a defensive position that would protect against every possible attack point, but also left the armies unable to support each other.\\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): Planning for the next battle was less based on emotion and more focused on what?\\nAh, so.. the reality of unfolding events\\n\\nQuestion: The War of the Austrian Succession had seen the belligerents aligned on a time-honoured basis. France’s traditional enemies, Great Britain and Austria, had coalesced just as they had done against Louis XIV. Prussia, the leading anti-Austrian state in Germany, had been supported by France. Neither group, however, found much reason to be satisfied with its partnership: British subsidies to Austria had produced nothing of much help to the British, while the British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria. Prussia, having secured Silesia, had come to terms with Austria in disregard of French interests. Even so, France had concluded a defensive alliance with Prussia in 1747, and the maintenance of the Anglo-Austrian alignment after 1748 was deemed essential by the Duke of Newcastle, British secretary of state in the ministry of his brother Henry Pelham. The collapse of that system and the aligning of France with Austria and of Great Britain with Prussia constituted what is known as the “diplomatic revolution” or the “reversal of alliances.”\\nTry to answer this question if possible: What was gained or lost by Austria?\\nAnswer: British military effort had not saved Silesia for Austria\\n\\nInput: Read this: Canonical jurisprudential theory generally follows the principles of Aristotelian-Thomistic legal philosophy.

       "    'content': 'input: At age 20, Fonda started his acting career at the Omaha Community Playhouse, when his mother\\'s friend Dodie Brando (mother of Marlon Brando) recommended that he try out for a juvenile part in You and I, in which he was cast as Ricky. He was fascinated by the stage, learning everything from set construction to stage production, and embarrassed by his acting ability. When he received the lead in Merton of the Movies, he realized the beauty of acting as a profession, as it allowed him to deflect attention from his own tongue-tied personality and create stage characters relying on someone else\\'s scripted words. Fonda decided to quit his job and go east in 1928 to seek his fortune.  He arrived on Cape Cod and played a minor role at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts. A friend took him to Falmouth, MA where he joined and quickly became a valued member of the University Players, an intercollegiate summer stock company. There he worked with Margaret Sullavan, his future wife. James Stewart joined the Players a few months after Fonda left, though they were soon to become lifelong friends. Fonda left the Players at the end of their 1931-1932 season after appearing in his first professional role in The Jest, by Sem Benelli. Joshua Logan, a young sophomore at Princeton who had been double-cast in the show, gave Fonda the part of Tornaquinci, \"an elderly Italian man with a long white beard and even longer hair.\" Also in the cast of The Jest with Fonda and Logan were Bretaigne Windust, Kent Smith, and Eleanor Phelps.  The tall (6 ft, 1.5 in) Fonda headed for New York City, to be with his then wife, Margaret Sullavan. The marriage was brief, but when James Stewart came to New York his luck changed. Getting contact information from Joshua Logan, Jimmy, as he was called, found Hank Fonda and these small town boys found they had a lot in common, as long as they didn\\'t discuss politics. The two men became roommates and honed their skills on Broadway. Fonda appeared in theatrical productions from 1926 to 1934. They fared no better than many Americans in and out of work during the Great Depression, sometimes lacking enough money to take the subway.\\n\\nAnswer this question \"Did he work anywhere else other than the Omaha Community Playhouse?\"\\noutput: He arrived on Cape Cod and played a minor role at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts.\\nQuestion: Born into a Bosniak family near Tuzla, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, she grew up in Brcko, the youngest child of Abid Jahic (c. 1928 - 22 October 2010) and Ifeta (nee Smajlovic; 15 April 1934 - 21 November 2014). Both of her parents are originally from villages near Srebrenik; her father was born in Jezinac and her maternal family hailed from Cehaje. Fahreta grew up in a Muslim home with sister Faketa and brother Faruk. At the start of the Bosnian War in 1992, her sister Faketa escaped to Canada, where she lives today, while Brena stayed in Belgrade where she had been living since 1980.\\n\\n1984 saw Brena and her band begin a cooperation with a new manager and producer, Raka Dokic. Bato, Bato, their third album, was released the same year. A new provocative image was accompanied by a new musical style, different from the one fostered by Popovic. Later that year, they held a concert in neighboring Romania, at the stadium in Timisoara to an audience of 65,000, what was at time among the most successful concerts of a Yugoslav musician outside their home country.  Their next three albums, Pile moje (1985) and Voli me, voli and Uske pantalone (both 1986) would propel her to the throne of the Yugoslav music scene. Along with these albums, Brena established a cooperation with Serbian folk star Miroslav Ilic and recorded a collaborative extended play Jedan dan zivota, which featured four songs, including a romantic duet called \"Jedan dan zivota\", and the song \"Zivela Jugoslavija\", which was received with a mixed response. The latter song was in line with Brena\\'s only official political stance: an uncompromising support of a united Yugoslavia, with her becoming a symbol of this view. By the end of 1986, Lepa Brena had become the star of Belgrade social jet-set, and the most successful public figure in Yugoslavia.  Brena\\'s manager Raka Dokic came up with the idea that her seventh studio album should be followed by a movie in which she would play the lead role. This idea was successfully implemented in 1987 when the motion picture Hajde da se volimo was filmed. The movie had the same name as the album. Many then-popular Yugoslav actors co-starred in the film, including Dragomir Gidra Bojanic, Milutin Karadzic, Velimir Bata Zivojinovic, Milan Strljic, etc. During the premiere of the film on 24 October 1987, Brena met her future husband, Serbian tennis star Slobodan Zivojinovic.  Based on the success of the original, two sequels were produced: Hajde da se volimo 2 (1989) and Hajde da se volimo 3 (1990), which was followed by the studio album Boli me uvo za sve. Boli me uvo za sve also had multiple hit songs including \"Cik pogodi\", \"Bice belaja\", \"Tamba Lamba\", and the title track. Their eighth studio album Cetiri godine was released on 1 October 1989 and contained the controversial song Jugoslovenka with Bosnian rock musician Alen Islamovic. The music video for the pop-folk song Cuvala me mama was filmed on the Croatian island Lopud.  Lepa Brena and Slati Greh held more than 350 concerts yearly, and would often hold two concerts in one day. They set a record by holding thirty-one concerts consecutively at Dom Sindikata, and seventeen concerts consecutively at the Sava Center. On 24 July 1990, Brena was lowered with a helicopter at Levski stadium in Sofia, Bulgaria, and held her then-most-attended concert with an audience of 110,000 people. While she was in Bulgaria in July 1990, she met with the Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Who are Bato, Bato and Hajde de se volimo?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'question: A Texas man killed four women -- including his girlfriend and a woman he was dating -- and wounded three teens and a boy in shootings at two Dallas-area homes, police said Thursday. The man was arrested at the second home after a child there called 911, according to police. When the shootings were done Wednesday night, there were two slain women and two wounded minors at each location -- one in Dallas and the other in DeSoto, roughly 15 miles to the south. Authorities identified those killed as Zina Bowser, 47, Neima Williams, 28, Toya Smith, 43, and Tasmia Allen, 17. They said the suspect in the shootings is 44-year-old Erbie Bowser, who was dating Smith. Zina Bowser was Bowser\\'s estranged wife, they said. When asked about a possible motive, DeSoto police spokesman Nick Bristow said that authorities believe \"it just to be an isolated domestic issue.\" The Dallas Mavericks said Bowser used to be a member of the NBA team\\'s Mavs ManiAACs, an all-male hip-hop dance troupe that entertains fans at games. He left the squad in 2009, Mavericks spokesman Scott Tomlin said. Bowser was a special education teacher for Mesquite Independent School District east of Dallas from December 2001 through March 2010, last teaching at Berry Middle School, district spokeswoman Laura Jobe said. He resigned and \"left us on good terms,\" she said. CNN\\'s attempts to contacts Bowser\\'s relatives weren\\'t immediately successful. Relative had bad feeling after call. Authorities learned of the Dallas shootings at 10:30 p.m., when relatives found the carnage there and called 911, police said. Beforehand, one of the victims had talked to her mother on the phone. Something about the conversation concerned the mother, so after calling back and getting no response, she drove with some family members to the Dallas home, where they saw the four who had been shot, Dallas police Maj. Jeff Cotner said. Toya Smith and her 17-year-old daughter were dead inside the house. Injured were the woman\\'s 14-year-old son and a 17-year-old girl who was a family friend, Cotner said. The 14-year-old was in critical condition Thursday. Dallas police had reason to suspect the gunman might have a DeSoto connection, and called DeSoto police, Cotner said. Minutes later -- at 10:45 p.m., while police were traveling to check the DeSoto home -- a child called 911 to report the shooting there, DeSoto police spokeswoman Melissa Franks said. The gunman had used \"some sort of explosive device,\" and then shot at the people inside, Franks said. Zina Bowser and Neima Williams were killed there, and two boys -- ages 11 and 13 -- were injured, she said. Both were in critical condition Thursday. Police arrested the suspect there without incident, she said. Dallas and DeSoto investigators are working together on the case. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is investigating the nature of the explosive device, Franks said. No explanation for Florida shooting rampage that leaves 7 dead. CNN\\'s Paul Caron, Tina Burnside and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.\\n\\nanswer: Police say man killed four women; one was a girlfriend, another an estranged wife.

Lizzie Edmonds. Missing: Andrew Ian Wyatt was last seen two weeks ago leaving a lodge near Nelson, South Island, New Zealand. Mountain rescuers searching for a British hiker in New Zealand have recovered a body at the bottom of a cliff, police have said. Andrew Ian Wyatt, 41, thought to be from Cornwall, was last seen leaving a lodge in Nelson Lakes National Park near the city of Nelson in the country\\'s south island on December 15. The body, which has yet to be formally identified, was found below the 330ft  Lake Constance Bluff - part of Mr Wyatt\\'s intended tramping trail. New Zealand police said bad weather had prevented the expert alpine searchers from accessing the area earlier. Four ground teams, one dog team and a communications team were then flown by helicopter to the region to begin the search. Search co-ordinator Constable Dave Cogger said he was in daily contact with Mr Wyatt\\'s parents in the UK who were extremely concerned for their son\\'s welfare. Mr Wyatt arrived in New Zealand on November 21 with the intention of walking the Te Araroa Trail - a 1,860-mile tramping trail which links routes from Cape Reinga to Bluff. On the day he went missing he left the Blue Lake Hut about 6am local time to walk to Waiau Pass. The area between the last sighting of Mr Wyatt and his next intended destination was \\'one of the more remote and difficult parts\\' of the trail, the training officer for Search and Rescue Nelson said. Sherp Tucker told local paper the Sunday Star Times: \\'It\\'s rugged, it\\'s remote and the weather can change so much. \\'It\\'s a frequent place for the rescue helicopter to go to beacon activations for people who are hurt.\\' Trek: The hiker was last seen leaving  popular trek stop the Blue Lake Hut, pictured, at 6am on December 15. Last seen: The hut is located in a remote part of the the Nelson Lakes National Park, pictured. Location: Mr Wyatt was due to walk the Waiau Pass in the Nelson Lakes National Park, pictured.

In January 1595, the king declared war on Spain to show Catholics that Spain was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French state—and to show Protestants that his conversion had not made him a puppet of Spain. Also, he hoped to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain. The conflict mostly consisted of military action aimed at League members, such as the Battle of Fontaine-Française, though the Spanish launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking Doullens, Cambrai and Le Catelet and in the spring of 1596 capturing Calais by April. Following the Spanish capture of Amiens in March 1597 the French crown laid siege until its surrender in September. With that victory Henry\\'s concerns then turned to the situation in Brittany where he promulgated the Edict of Nantes and sent Bellièvre and Brulart de Sillery to negotiate a peace with Spain. The war was drawn to an official close after the Edict of Nantes, with the Peace of Vervins in May 1598.\\n\\nWhat happened second: king declared war on Spain or members still worked against Henry?\\nAnswer: king declared war on Spain\\n\\n\\nProblem: In 2006, there were 2,381,500 households of average size 2.1 people.

OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n\\nA: negative\\n\\nQ: Confused that the Yelp listing is not Todd English's Olives, as the restaurant signage, menu, and promotional materials state. I guess Todd himself dined here and had an experience similar to mine, and didn't want his name associated with the place.  The food ranged from tasty cheese on the charcuterie board and surprisingly good espresso martinis, to average/mediocre everything else- and we ordered a lot. Tables are initially served a breadbasket with three mismatched breads, and a tray of olives and two tapenades- the green is best.  CHARCUTERIE BOARD: two types of tasty cheeses (one was a blue), two types of meat (salami and prosciutto?), dates, candied walnuts, and crisps. Wish I could tell you what type of cheese it was, but all dishes were presented without any sort of explanation or comment. FOIE GRAS: served with fresh fig (singular), port reduction (gross), and truffle crema (tastless, certainly no truffle here). Served without any sort of crackers or bread, and our breadbasket was empty and no one ever refilled it.  Did not care for the texture, flavors seemed off. Would have shared this with my server, but we never saw him.  BRICK OVEN ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN: served with a potato cake and green means, all amid a sea of tasty jus, but the chicken itself was bland. Recurring issue with dishes here. Again, even just salt would have helped this dish. BONE-IN NY STRIP SPECIAL: served with green beans and fingerling potatoes, steak was plated with a giant puddle of some sort of cabernet sauce? Guess it was meant to hide the fact that the meat was flavorless aside from gobs of fat in every bite, and unseasoned to the point that it desperately needed salt. No char or sear at all.   MUSHROOM RISOTTO: decent-ish side, mediocre version of a favorite dish. The table ate the entire portion though. CRISPY ZUCCHINI: no menu description, expected a roasted version but received a plate of tempura zuke covered with cheese. Hard not to like that but odd considering the rest of the menu.   As you can see, we had issues with the service. The restaurant wasn't that busy, yet we rarely saw our server. Literally went 20 minutes wanting a martini that I couldn't order because he never came by. When he did, he didn't seem to care at all. We were asked what we wanted to drink, what we wanted to order, and if we had any questions- no intro, no script, no explanation of specials, devoid of personality. Didn't even ask to see a dessert menu because we were so put off by the flavorless food and nonexistent service. OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive\\n\\nA:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Sale of Plaza Hotel had to happen\\n\\nA likely sale of the Plaza Hotel would mark one of the shortest ownership reigns of an iconic Manhattan property ever. But the “nightmare” crisis facing Mumbai-based Sahara Group, which bought the Plaza last November, made the offering all but inevitable.\\n\\nAs we wrote Monday on nypost.com, Sahara is trying to sell the Plaza, the Dream Downtown Hotel and London’s Grosvenor House. The Times of India, citing three sources close to the situation, reported that Sahara has already received a $1.6 billion offer from an unidentified Mideast group.\\n\\nSahara, led by mega-billionaire Subrata Roy>, bought a 70 percent stake in the Plaza just last November from Israeli-owned Elad for $600 million. It also bought the Dream Downtown from Vikram Chatwal’s Hampshire Hotels for $200 million. In 2010, it bought Grosvenor House from Royal Bank of Scotland for $726 million.\\n\\nut, “Almost from the day Sahara bought the Plaza, they had financial and legal problems outside the US,” said a New York hotel industry insider who was surprised they’d gone largely unnoticed here.\\n\\nSahara is under siege by Indian securities regulators who said the company sold $4.8 billion in bonds in violation of national laws, and by Bank of China which holds nearly $1 billion in debt on the three properties.\\n\\nSahara’s woes have been widely described as a “$5 billion nightmare” in India and in Europe. But New York coverage has focused on Sant Chatwal’s Hampshire Hotel Management’s heavily publicized contract to run the Plaza’s Oak Room, Oak Bar and Palm Court — a deal Elad made before the sale to Sahara. Hampshire has tapped famed chef Geoffrey Zakarian to oversee the project.\\n\\nThe Plaza is managed by Fairmont while Hampshire continues to manage the Dream Downtown, but there’s no telling what effect a change of ownership might have on either company’s role.\\n\\nCBRE Hotels vice-president Bradley Burwell, a hotel sale broker not involved in the Sahara offering, said both New York inns were doing well on the operating level. He noted that Sahara had smartly consolidated the several ownership entities which Elad had carved out of the hotel — including condo units for each of the restaurants and the subterranean food hall — “into a single ownership entity.”\\n\\nBurwell wouldn’t predict what the new owners would do, but said he would “assume” they’d want to operate the Plaza their own way — possibly with new management.\\n\\nA different hotel industry source noted, “I’m sure Chatwal had ambitions to one day displace Fairmont as operator of the Plaza” — and now both will be working for new bosses.\\n\\nThat source noted, however, that Fairmont has a safety blanket in that Saudi Prince Al-Waleed, a minority owner of the Plaza, is also part-owner of Fairmont.\\n\\nThe Plaza has 280 guest rooms, many fewer than the original 800 after Elad converted much of the building to luxury condo apartments. The Dream Downtown has 315 rooms.\\n\\nA rep for Sahara said Tuesday morning the company has “only received an offer for Grosvenor House.

You just relax and play the game.\"\\n\\nJames bristled when Valanciunas offered to help him up, and later when asked about his response.\\n\\n\"Why would I need his help (getting) up?\" James asked. \"My teammates will come get me. That\\'s all that matters.\"\\n\\nThe foul was upgraded to flagrant following a video review.\\n\\n\"I wasn\\'t trying to hurt him, I was just trying to stop him from dunking,\" Valanciunas said.\\n\\nJames has taken some notably tough fouls lately. There were some flagrants in the Cavaliers\\' recent game against the Rockets, including Harden foot-nudging him in the friendlies.\\n\\nIt feels like this all coincides with the addition of Kendrick Perkins in Cleveland. As soon as LeBron gets himself a recognized NBA bodyguard, he starts taking more hits — \\x80\\x94not that James wasn\\'t getting knocked around before.\\n\\nThere probably aren\\'t two players in the league who get fouled harder than James and Blake Griffin, and there\\'s a reason for that: They\\'re so big and they move so fast.\\n\\nHistorically, guys that size who move at that speed \\x80\\x94get knocked around. It\\'s part of the gig. And when you\\'re as tremendous a finisher as James, people would much rather send you to the line than give you the layup or tomahawk slam or whatever other thing you\\'ll do to ensure the ball goes in the hoop. Thus, you see plays like Valanciunas\\' when the last line of defense gets caught flat-footed. Just don\\'t let Jonas play linebacker.\\n\\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\\n\\nsummary: LeBron James has been getting beaten up lately. Add Jonas Valanciunas to the list of his enemies.\\n\\nHillary Clinton on the road to Iowa as Marco Rubio enters race - live\\n\\nThe 2016 presidential election need not be a circus that only Americans enjoy (or loathe) – gamblers of all nationalities can get in on the drama too.\\n\\nTo that end, bookmakers William Hill and Paddy Power have published their current odds for declared candidates and the politicians lurking in the wings, who may or may not join the contest.\\n\\nTo win the Democratic primary, both bookmakers have Clinton as an overwhelming favorite, at 1/3 and 1/4 odds of winning the party’s nomination. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren is a distant second, at 5/1 and 13/2, followed by vice-president Joe Biden, at 20/1 odds.\\n\\nRepublicans, too, have a strong favorite, but the competitors are far closer. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the third Bush to seek the highest office, has 2/1 odds from both bookmakers to win the nomination. They put Wisconsin governor Scott Walker at 5/1 and 4/1 odds, and at this point the gambling gods disagree. William Hill gives 7/1 odds to senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, while Paddy Power hands the more moderate Rubio an edge at 9/2 and his libertarian rival a 6/1 chance.\\n\\nAs for the 2016 presidency itself, both bookmakers agree: Clinton (5/4, 11/10) and Bush (4/1, 4/1) are the titans to beat.\\n\\nWalker (10/1, 12/1) and Rubio (14/1, 12/1) are outliers by comparison. Biden, Cruz and others hardly rank, at current odds of more than 30/1.\\n\\nBut odds, like polls, are subject to change, and frontrunners have fallen despite seemingly insurmountable leads before. Just ask Hillary Clinton. Or maybe don’t.\\n\\nsummary:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'question: A third person, identified as a minor girl, died from injuries suffered in the Asiana Airlines crash last week, hospital officials said. She had been in critical condition at the Bay Area hospital since the July 6 crash, San Francisco General spokeswoman Rachael Kagan said. The hospital didn\\'t release any additional information about her -- including her name, age or ethnicity -- in keeping with her parents\\' wishes. \"It\\'s a very, very sad day today at San Francisco General Hospital,\" said Dr. Geoffrey Manley, chief of neurosurgery. \"We have all done everything we could.\" Q&A: How does an air crash investigation work? Two others -- both 16-year-old girls from China -- were reported dead soon after the Boeing 777 crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. One of those teenagers was hit on the runway by a fire truck, though it\\'s unclear whether she was already dead when she was struck, San Francisco police spokesman Albie Esparza said. At the time, firefighters were using flame retardant that ended up surrounding areas immediately around the plane with foam, Esparza said. \"When the truck repositioned itself to get a better aim of the fuselage, they discovered the body of the victim in the fresh track from the path of the truck,\" he added. The foam was thick enough to cover a body, Esparza noted. Moreover, it is difficult for those in the \"industrial-size\" fire trucks that responded to crash to see things on the ground, the police spokesman said. \"Right now, we are waiting results from the coroner to determine if she died from the crash or the fire engine going over her,\" the police spokesman said. \"And that will be part of our investigations, like any other case, by our hit-and-run and major accidents investigations teams.\" Of the passengers and crew on board, 304 people survived -- 123 of whom walked away relatively unscathed. The others were sent to hospitals. Opinion: Our terror over flying has cost us. A handful of them remained hospitalized, including six patients at San Francisco General. That hospital\\'s figure includes two adults in critical condition with spinal cord injuries, abdominal injuries, internal bleeding, road rash and fractures. San Francisco International Airport is also working to get back to normal. The plane\\'s fuselage was hauled away on flatbed trucks Friday to a remote section of the airport, San Francisco International Airport said in a news release. On Friday, a Southwest Airlines jet landed on the runway where the crash occurred -- signifying that, for the first time in six days, all four of the airport\\'s runways were operational. \"The tremendous efforts and around-the-clock work of airport staff, government agencies, airline tenants and contractors allowed us to complete all repairs and safety certifications for Runway 28L in a timely and efficient manner,\" airport director John L. Martin said. While the wreckage has been hauled away, investigators still have not pinpointed exactly why Flight 214 crashed, or who was to blame. Did Asiana pilot have enough 777 experience? An in-depth review of the cockpit voice recorder shows two pilots called for the landing to be aborted before the plane hit a seawall and crashed onto the runway, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said. The first internal call by one of the three pilots in the cockpit to abort the landing came three seconds before the crash. A second call was made by another pilot 1.5 seconds before impact, NTSB chief Deborah Hersman said. The agency has begun wrapping up its investigation at the airport, and crews are cleaning up the debris left by the crash. Investigators turned the runway back over to the airport. CNN\\'s Chelsea J. Carter, Augie Martin and Ed Payne contributed to this report.\\n\\nanswer: All four runways at San Francisco\\'s airport are now operational, airport says. A girl, who\\'d been in critical condition, died at a San Francisco hospital. A teen who died earlier was hit by fire truck, police say. Her body was believed to be covered in foam sprayed by firefighters, spokesman says.\\nquestion: By. Craig Mackenzie. PUBLISHED:. 03:46 EST, 9 September 2012. |. UPDATED:. 03:46 EST, 9 September 2012. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay will soon be facing new competition in the kitchen - from his estranged father-in-law. Chris Hutcheson and his son Adam are launching a chain of healthy \\xadfast-food restaurants called Scoffs. The eateries will reportedly serve \\'British tapas\\' for diet-conscious office workers and the first one will be opened in central London. At war: Chris Hutcheson, left, got a £2million payoff after he was dismissed by his son-in-law Gordon Ramsay. Hutcheson and Adam, who used to be head of pubs at Ramsay’s restaurant group, expects the chain to grow to 20 to 30 restaurants within 18 months. His adviser David Rawlinson said: \\'Chris and Adam have an incredible wealth of experience in catering and plan to roll out the concept.\\' Hutcheson was dismissed in October 2010 after Kitchen Nightmares star Ramsay accused him\\xa0 of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising. Ramsay also claimed that Hutcheson put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five-figure cheques to himself. Glamour couple Ramsay and his wife Tana: She was one of the last to know her father had a secret family. Feud: Hutcheson and his wife Greta. His gagging order revealing details of his life was lifted in the High Court. Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed \\'monster\\' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages. Kitchen king: Chef Gordon Ramsay. Their feud was settled after Ramsay,  married to Hutcheson’s daughter Tana, reportedly paid £2million in February to buy his father-in-law’s 30 per cent stake in the business. Ramsay previously wrote an open letter criticising Hutcheson, who hit back claiming the cook was a monster and he knew where Gordon’s \\'bodies are buried\\'. It was not until May last year that the astonishing story behind Ramsay\\'s decision to sack his business partner emerged when the High Court lifted a gagging order Hutcheson had taken out to hush up his double life. Tana Ramsay was among the last in her family to learn that for more than three decades Hutcheson had had a second, secret family after fathering two children by his mistress Frances Collins. She is one of a string of women with whom Hutcheson allegedly betrayed his wife Greta, by whom he has four children, including Tana. Ramsay’s feud with his father-in-law has cost him at least £6 million. Papers filed at Companies House show that he paid out reorganisation costs of £2.4 million, wrote off a £1.7 million loan on a gastropub owned by Ramsay and Hutcheson and made a pre-tax loss of £4.4 million up to August 31, 2011. Last December Ramsay was awarded £250,000 costs after a judge ruled that Hutcheson, Tana\\'s sister Orlanda Butland and her brother Adam were liable for breach of confidence after hacking into personal emails and company computers.\\n\\nanswer:'},\n",

       "    'content': \"In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Mean girls feed on reactions. When they say or do something mean and you yell at them, start crying, or run away, they feel successful. Even if you feel a little hurt, try to keep yourself composed by reminding yourself that you’re strong enough to refuse to respond to and engage in negative behavior. If you’re composed, the mean girl won’t think she got to you.  Remind yourself that the goal of a bully is to get a reaction. If you don't react, then she loses. Try not to take the comments personally because they're not really about you. Bullies put others down because they feel bad about themselves. She wants you to feel bad so that she can feel better about herself. When the mean girl is mean to you, you might quickly feel a wave of negative emotions such as anger and sadness. Remove yourself from the situation for 5-10 minutes and go for a short walk or visit the restroom so that you can calm down. This will help keep you from being mean back to the girl or reacting in a way that’ll let her know you’re upset.  Deep breathing exercises can lower your blood pressure and help you de-stress. If you’re feeling upset, try inhaling through your nose for four seconds and exhaling through your nose for four more seconds. Repeat this until you feel more relaxed.  Come up with a mantra to tell yourself during difficult times. Try saying something like, “I am strong,” or “No one defines me but me,” repeatedly in your head until you’re more calm. If you act like the mean girl isn’t even there, you’ll remove her power completely. It takes strength and confidence to let hurtful words roll right off your back instead of internalizing them. Whenever the mean girl says or does hurtful things, don’t look at her or speak to her, and instead just continue with whatever you were doing before. If the mean girl is actually someone who you associate with and spend time with, it might be best to take a step away from the friendship. Make yourself a little less available and spend more time doing activities you love with true friends who are more kind to you. If you’ve tried to avoid the situation but she’s still being mean to you, it might be time to ask an adult for their help. Bring the problem up with any adult(s) you’re comfortable talking to, whether that’s your guidance counselor, parent(s), teacher(s), coach(es), or administrator(s). They may be able to give you advice and/or diffuse future situations.  If you’re physically harmed by the mean girl, tell an adult immediately.  If you’re worried that the mean girl may find out you that you told on her and harass you for it, ask the adult to keep it a secret. Don't ignore the issue if it's really bothering you. If you need help with taking steps toward addressing the situation, visit Stop Bullying at https://www.stopbullying.gov/.\\nSummary: Don’t react to her meanness. Separate yourself to calm down. Pretend that the mean girl is invisible. Distance yourself from a mean girl friend. Talk to an adult if the meanness doesn’t subside.\\n\\nIn one sentence, describe what the following article is about: You can work on your swing at home just the going through the motions again and again, and thinking about how you move each part of your body. Try suspending a ball from the ceiling in your garage, or from a basketball hoop, and taking lots of smooth controlled swings. Work from slow swings to fast swings.  If you have a tee to hit from, use this.  Try suspending the ball at different heights to give you practice of hitting balls at various heights. You can also try throwing a ball up into the air in front of you and hitting it on the first bounce. It might be easier to practice with some friends, teammates or a coach. If you have someone to toss you some balls, you will be able to recreate hitting in a game more effectively. You can vary the drills and work on improving your vision by using different coloured balls, or balls with numbers written onto them.  You will have to note the colour of the ball, or the number written on the ball, and call it out before you hit in. Improving your softball vision will help you to read balls better and hit with more accuracy. Speeding up your swing can have a big impact on the amount of power you are able to impart when you make contact with the ball. You can try swinging with a heavier bat in practice and when you are warming up. The idea is that when you switch to a lighter bat in the game you will swing with more power and speed.  A good drill to increase speed and reactions times is the quick toss drill. For this drill, have someone on the opposite side of the batter’s box to you. Your training partner will then toss you two balls in quick succession. You should try to hit the first and then quickly back in position and swing and hit the second. . Another way to improve your swing is to do some strength training. Using a heavier bat when you practice will work in the same way, but you can also add some specific weight or resistance training to your routine. Look for exercises that will strengthen your core, abs, legs and forearms. Some good exercises to do that can help your swing include:  Crunches. Leg raises. Back bows. Russian twists. Squats and lunges.\\nSummary: Practice on your own. Practice with friends or a coach. Speed up your swing. Increase your power and strength\\n\\nIn one sentence, describe what the following article is about: While there aren't any specific foods that have been proven to increase your flexibility, a good diet is essential for healthy and strong muscles and bones. Track your eating in a food diary for a couple of weeks so you can see what you're really putting into your body.  Eat foods that are as fresh as possible, rather than prepared meals, frozen dinners, and junk food. Create meal plans to ensure that your meals are balanced, and practice portion control. Flexibility requires healthy muscles, ligaments, and tendons. You can't expect optimal performance from muscles that are dehydrated. Dehydrated muscles also are tight and stiff. If you try to stretch stiff, dehydrated muscles, you could end up with a serious injury. Especially if you work out intensely or regularly engage in physical labor, a massage will help work out kinks and knots that develop in overworked muscles. Over time, these kinks and knots can significantly decrease your mobility.  You can use foam rollers to massage yourself, especially after workouts. Find a massage therapist and try to make an appointment for a massage once every few months. It's not only relaxing but also can help with your goal to become more flexible. When you're stressed out, you can carry a lot of tension in your muscles. This will cause you to be significantly less flexible. If you don't take time to relax and unwind, you will quickly undo any progress you've made towards becoming more flexible.\\nSummary:\"},\n",

       "    'content': 'Problem: Write a positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) yelp review.\\nA: Authentic Moroccan food. This place is truly unique to Las Vegas as we do not have another Moroccan restaurant here, (Marrakech is faux Moroccan, sorry). This place is tucked away in a strip mall behind Outback, little difficult to find if you\\'re not familiar with this center.   We started out with a bottle of Moroccan wine, not on the menu, but just ask, it was really good, if you like Cabs, you will like this wine.   Ameen, our waiter had suggested we start out with the Calamari Steak appetizer as well as the Pastilla. The presentation of both was so pretty, I didn\\'t want to ruin it by eating it! The Calamari was so tender and soft, it melted in your mouth, the flavors of lemon and the chickpea relish really made this dish different from any other way I\\'ve had calamari. The Pastilla was almost like dessert, I love sweet and savory and this dish nailed it. Layers of filo dough around chicken and egg with almond, dusted with cinnamon. It was delicious.    I love Tangine cooking, the meat is so tender and the flavors of the spices come bursting through the food. We tried two different dishes, Braised Short Rib and Mechoui Roasted Lamb. Both dishes were equally amazing, and very unique. The Short Ribs were so tender, the meat literally fell apart with a fork, the flavors were so evident, seasoned with cinnamon and honey, marcona almonds and dried apricots. This is served with Khobz, or Moroccan bread, to dip into the juices left in the Tangine. The Lamb Tangine was so good, seasoned with Sharmoula, a spice similar to cumin, and served with Harrisa, which is a condiment, the brilliant color of orange would make you think it is made with carrots, but it gets to color from roasted red peppers and smoked paprika. This is also served with fresh mint, the combination of the flavors were great.   We finished dinner with Mint Tea Almond Panna Cotta, very unique, not sweet at all and more of a citrus flavor.  On Fridays and Saturdays starting at 6:30 they have belly dancing, we caught a few songs, and she was really good!   This place was truly amazing, I can\\'t wait to return.\\n\\n\\nQ: negative\\n\\nA: I came here for lunch and I would like to come back and try something else and maybe revise my review but this first experience was just so blah. I wanted soup because, honestly, my office is so stinking cold I needed to warm up. I was torn between two soups: the tortilla and the chicken chili. The woman at the counter was very nice and gave me a taste of both. They were both fairly bland and average. I decided on the chicken chili and ordered it in a bread boule.   The soup was just so bland. It was salt, some corn starch to make it have that weird gelatinous texture thing going on and it was lacking in substance. Some little shredded pieces of chicken and that\\'s about it. I wanted some green chilis!! Or anything really to add some flavor. The bread was ok. Not great, not terrible.   Overall, I was fairly disappointed but I would be willing to give it another shot and try something different on the menu. The menu is pretty varied, which was a good thing.\\n\\n\\nProblem: What would be an example of an negative (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) review?\\n\\nAnswer: Avoid.   We had one of the worst servers ever.   \"may I reccomend a steak for sir ? and perhaps a salad for the lady\" ?!?! We gave him cash for our cheque and when I handed it to him, he asked \"how much change would you like ?\" The cheek! Beers were tasty. Food was average.\\n\\n\\nInput: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive.\\nGenerate a negative review for a place\\nOutput: It hurts to write this review because I have been to Jose Andres\\' restaurants in Washington DC and I have absolutely loved them and had great experiences with his food.  However, China Poblano was absolutely terrible. My husband and I tried items from the Mexican AND the Chinese menu and while the Mexican was slightly better, everything we tried was awful. Everything on the menu is tapas sized, so you are expected to order 3-4 items per person. Luckily we decided to start slow..We had a number of different tacos (lobster, fried fish and mushroom) and all were greasy and tasteless. The guacamole and chips (which was $15!!) was ok. LIttle did we know that it would be the only truly edible thing we ordered! We then decided to try some Chinese items and got some traditional shu mail dumplings and mongolian beef stir fry. The dumplings had a bizarre raw pork flavor to them that was so disgusting that I actually couldnt even swallow the dumpling and the mongolian beef stir fry was completely bizarre... tiny little chunks of grisly beef stir fried with pieces of romaine lettuce?! And then the icing on the cake was the bill.. I know this is Las Vegas and I certainly wasnt expecting a budget dinner, but since we ordered very little food (4 tacos, an order of guac, the dumplings and the beef) and only ordered two agua frescas and no alcohol I was absolutely FLOORED when I saw that the bill was over $100!   Definitely skip China Poblano-- if you want to try Jose Andres\\' fabulous food-- go to Washington DC... because you certainly won\\'t find it here at China Poblano!\\n\\n\\ninput: Write a negative yelp review (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive).\\noutput:'},\n",

Furthermore, mature markets for the first time received less PC shipments than emerging economies in 2010, making emerging markets now responsible for more than half of all computers in use worldwide. In addition with software infringement rates of 68 percent comparing to 24 percent of mature markets, emerging markets thus possess the majority of the global increase in the commercial value of counterfeit software.

The most prevalent answers among Canadian adolescents were to \"get in a party mood,\" 18%; \"because I enjoy it,\" 16%; and \"to get drunk,\" 10%.

Look for lengthening and shortening lines. Use the cutting lines. Check for sewing lines. Sew in darts. Watch out for fold lines.\"\\narticle: Every pattern comes with step-by-step instructions on a separate sheet (user guide), as well as the pattern template sheet (pattern tissue). You should always read the instructions in the user guide before starting the sewing project so that you\\'re aware of what\\'s expected. The advice will include how to cut out the template sheet (pattern tissue), how to construct the garment or item, the best way to select sizing, etc. Check the pattern instructions to find out if the pattern is with or without seam allowances. If it does not include seam allowances, you\\'ll need to cut the fabric with the seam allowances later. It is more normal for seam allowances not to be included. This is a long straight line with arrow heads at one or both ends. This arrow tells you which direction the paper pattern pieces should sit over the grain of the weave (which direction the grain of the fabric needs to go). For stretch fabrics, they might indicate the direction with most stretch. The grain line of the fabric is the same as the direction of the selvage edges (the white edge where the pattern ends). Simply locate the selvage edge to determine the grain line or direction of the fabric. These are the triangular marks on the cutting lines. Use them for matching panels precisely, such as an arm in an armhole. You can get single, double, and triple notches. Pros will make tiny cuts into the seam allowance where these notches are but beginners should cut mirrored triangles beyond the cut line, in order to line up the pattern pieces. Usually a single notch indicates the front of a garment while a double notch indicates the back. This is not universal, however. These little circles can show where darts, zips, pockets, or gatherings are to be added, though they usually indicate where you need to place tacks in order to line up two layers of fabric. Refer to your pattern instructions if you are unsure.  If the pattern does not explain and you see two matching dots on opposite pieces of the pattern, then it is reasonable to assume that these two match up. Zipper lines are almost always indicated with a zig-zag line. Button placement is usually shown with an X, while buttonholes are marked with a bracket line (like the number lines you drew in your math classes), marking the actual size of the buttonhole. These are parallel lines, usually placed very close together, that show where you can increase or reduce the size of the pattern to improve fit. Always read your pattern instructions to understand how to deal with these, as it usually varies between patterns. This line is the thick, solid on the outside of a pattern. You should cut along this line. Sometimes it will not be solid and you will see a large number of lines. These indicate that a number of different sizes can be cut, by following a specific pattern line. Sometimes the size is listed on or near the line, sometimes it is listed in the instructions. Sometimes this broken or dotted line is included to indicate where the sewing occurs. It\\'s often left out because there is a standard understanding that the sewing occurs 5/8\" or 15mm inside the cutting line, so if you don\\'t see it, don\\'t panic. If you see a large triangle or diamond shape in your pattern, this is usually to indicate a dart. Darts shape a single piece of fabric to make it fit around a curved form. These lines, usually clearly labeled on indicated with a special line or bracket, indicate where a piece of fabric should be folded, not cut. Be careful not to cut along this line.\\n\\nWrite an article based on this \"Improve yourself by watching videos or attending a pottery class.\"\\narticle: If you\\'re enjoying working with clay and want to extend your skills, consider attending a local pottery class.

For example, you could try wearing a pearl necklace or a pair of pearl earrings. Other great feminine jewelry options include statement necklaces, bow shaped earrings, and anything pink. If you are trying to downplay the look, then you may want to opt for something very simple or skip the jewelry altogether. The shoes you wear can also change the tone of your outfit. You can dress up a tulle skirt with some high heels, or dress it down with a pair of flats.  To build more contrast into your look, try wearing a pair of sneakers or combat boots with your tulle skirt. If you want to bring out your inner ballerina even more, then wear a pair of ballet flats. However, it is best to avoid anything that laces up your ankles because it may make you look like you are wearing a ballerina costume. Wearing tights with a tulle skirt is a good option in cold weather, but you can also go bare-legged if the weather is warm enough. If you decide to wear tights with your tulle skirt, then choose a color that will complement your skirt. Black tights are usually a good option, but you can try other colors as well. For example, you could pair pale pink tights with a pale pink tulle skirt, or purple tights with a purple skirt. Adding a belt to your tulle skirt look can be a great way to accentuate your waistline. Try wearing a wide belt around your natural waist for a slimming effect. You can try a slim belt as well.

(C-SPAN)\\n\\nWith his call for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” Donald Trump has crossed an uncrossable line of bigotry and xenophobia. The Republican front-runner presents a clearer, more present danger to U.S. interests than the supposedly threatening Muslims he seeks to exclude. He is a one-man recruiting tool for the Islamic State.\\n\\nRuth Marcus is a columnist for The Post, specializing in American politics and domestic policy.\\n\\nThis was not Trump off the cuff, a Trump gaffe, Trump taken out of context or Trump responding ambiguously to a leading suggestion.\\n\\nIt was Trump being Trump, which is to say crude, intolerant and ignorant. Yet nothing Trump has said previously comes close to this un-American suggestion.\\n\\nAnd nothing in my experience of U.S. politics has been so sickening, has made me so embarrassed for my country. Who could have imagined that any supposedly mainstream political candidate — no less the front-runner of a major political party — would propose anything so extreme?\\n\\nHow would Trump enforce this? By questioning entrants about their religion? By singling out those with particular names or from particular countries? What actual terrorist would “confess” to being Muslim? What other Muslim — any Muslim, anywhere — would not be grievously offended? Are we supposed to somehow feel better that Trump’s next-day clarification allowed that U.S.-citizen Muslims could return to this country?\\n\\nIndeed, given his assessment of the alleged dangers of Muslim visitors, would Trump stop at foreign Muslims? After all, he cited a poll, conducted by a right-wing, anti-Islam group, purporting to show that 25 percent of the 600 polled believe that “[v]iolence against Americans here in the United States can be justified as part of the global jihad.” And he has refused to say whether he would have interned Japanese Americans during World War II, or even whether, in retrospect, the camps violated American values.\\n\\nMaybe, just maybe, Trump — after calling Mexicans rapists, questioning John McCain’s war heroism, criticizing Carly Fiorina’s looks, mocking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski’s disability — has finally entered self-destruction territory. His latest is not simple offensiveness — it is the marriage of offensiveness and policy.\\n\\nThere is some reason for hope, in the appalled reaction of most of Trump’s Republican opponents. Trump’s “habit of making offensive and outlandish statements will not bring Americans together,” said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Jeb Bush termed Trump “unhinged.” New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Trump’s proposal “is the kind of thing people say when they have no experience and no idea what they’re talking about.”\\n\\nOthers were shamefully mild. A spokesman for Ben Carson said visitors “should register and be monitored during their stay,” but that “we do not and would not advocate being selective on one’s religion.” (Except for saying earlier that a Muslim shouldn’t be president, that is.)\\n\\nAnd Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), hoping to lure Trump voters if and when he craters, could only manage to choke out, “That is not my policy,” adding, “I believe the focus should focus on radical Islamic terrorism.” There’s a beacon of moral bravery — topped off by Cruz the next day, offering, “I do not believe the world needs my voice added to that chorus of [Trump] critics.”\\n\\nAll Republican lawmakers, party officials and candidates must immediately renounce Trump and assert that they will not support this demagogue at the top of the ticket. Failing to do so implicitly associates them with Trump’s bigotry. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) went halfway, saying that Trump’s proposal “is not what this party stands for. And more importantly, it’s not what this country stands for.” If so, why does Ryan say he’ll support “whoever the Republican nominee is”?\\n\\nTrump speaks to a fear of Islamist terrorism that is palpable and understandable. There will always be some space in politics — and some temptation for politicians — to cater to the ugly, nativist instincts that such anxiety generates.\\n\\nIn European countries, these urges often find their outlet in fringe parties — or, perhaps, not so fringe. See France, where Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Front led after the first round of recent regional elections; Le Pen has called for an end to all immigration, legal and illegal.\\n\\nThe United States does not have a tradition of robust third parties; our extremists, of the left and right, must try to find a home within the two-party system. And when someone like Trump goes too far — when his approach, as former vice president Dick Cheney said, “goes against everything we stand for and believe in” — the parties have a responsibility, to the country as well as to themselves, to discredit the messenger and denounce his message.\\n\\nRead more from Ruth Marcus’s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.\\nWhat was this article about?\\n++++++++++\\nIt\\'s about:'},\n",

Mystery\\nFor nearly 16 years, puzzle enthusiasts have labored to decipher an 865-character coded message stenciled into a sculpture on the grounds of the Central Intelligence Agency\\'s headquarters in Langley, Va. This week, the sculptor gave them an unsettling but hopeful surprise: part of the message they thought they had deciphered years ago actually says something else.\\n\\nThe sculpture, titled \"Kryptos,\" the Greek word for \"hidden,\" includes an undulating sheet of copper with a message devised by the sculptor, Jim Sanborn, and Edward M. Scheidt, a retired chairman of the C.I.A.\\'s cryptographic center.\\n\\nThe message is broken into four sections, and in 1999, a computer programmer named Jim Gillogly announced he had figured out the first three, which include poetic ramblings by the sculptor and an account of the opening of King Tut\\'s tomb. The C.I.A. then announced that one of its physicists, David Stein, had also deciphered the first three sections a year earlier.\\n\\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Sanborn left a phone message for Elonka Dunin, a computer game developer who also runs an e-mail list for enthusiasts trying to solve the \"Kryptos\" puzzle. For the first time, Mr. Sanborn had done a line-by-line analysis of his text with what Mr. Gillogly and Mr. Stein had offered as the solution and discovered that part of the solved text was incorrect.\\n\\nWithin minutes, Ms. Dunin called back, and Mr. Sanborn told her that in the second section, one of the X\\'s he had used as a separator between sentences had been omitted, altering the solution. \"He was concerned that it had been widely published incorrectly,\" Ms. Dunin said.\\n\\nMr. Sanborn\\'s admission was first reported Thursday by Wired News.\\n\\nMs. Dunin excitedly started sending instant messages online to Chris Hanson, the co-moderator of the \"Kryptos\" e-mail group. Within an hour, Ms. Dunin figured out what was wrong. The last eight characters of the second section, which describes something possibly hidden on C.I.A. grounds, had been decoded as \"IDBYROWS\" which people read as \"I.D. by rows\" or \"I.D. by Row S.\"\\n\\nIn an interview yesterday, Mr. Sanborn said he had never meant that at all. To give himself flexibility as he carved the letters into the copper sheet, he had marked certain letters that could be left out. In the second passage, he left out an X separator before these eight letters.\\n\\n\"It was purely an act of aesthetics on my part,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said he expected that the encryption method, which relies on the position of the letters, would transform that part of the message into gibberish, and that the solvers would know to go back and reinsert the missing separator. But \"remarkably, when you used the same system, it said something that was intelligible,\" Mr. Sanborn said. He decided to let the code breakers know about the error because \"they weren\\'t getting the whole story,\" he said.\\n\\nWhen Ms. Dunin reinserted the X, the eight characters became \"LAYERTWO.\" She called Mr. Sanborn again, who confirmed that was the intended message. \"It\\'s a surprise, and it\\'s exciting,\" Ms. Dunin said. That is the first real progress on \"Kryptos\" in more than six years. Now to figure out what it means.\\n\\nIn an e-mail interview, Mr. Gillogly said that the corrected text, \"layer two,\" is \"intriguing but scarcely definitive.\" He added, \"Like much of the sculpture, it can be taken in many ways.\" Mr. Gillogly, who has not worked much on the puzzle in recent years, said he would go back to see if the answer was now apparent.\\n\\nOne possibility is that \"layer two\" is the crucial key for solving the rest of the puzzle. Or it could be a hint that the letters need to be layered atop one another. Mr. Sanborn and Mr. Scheidt have said that even when all of the text is unraveled, other puzzles will remain in \"Kryptos.\"\\n\\n\"This new discovery could possibly make it easier to crack and possibly not make it easier to crack,\" Mr. Sanborn offered unhelpfully. \"It may be a dead-end diversion I like to send people on, a primrose lane to nowhere.\"\\n\\nMr. Scheidt said it had taken only three or four months to devise a puzzle that has lasted nearly 16 years, adding that only he, Mr. Sanborn and \"probably someone at C.I.A.\" know the answer.\\n\\nFor everyone else, the remaining 97 letters of the fourth section remain baffling (the slashes indicate line breaks):\\n\\nA version of this article appears in print on , on page A12 of the New York edition with the headline: A Break for Code Breakers on a C.I.A.

The minority leader, in consultation with other party colleagues, has a range of strategic options that he or she can employ to advance minority party objectives. The options selected depend on a wide range of circumstances, such as the visibility or significance of the issue and the degree of cohesion within the majority party. For instance, a majority party riven by internal dissension, as occurred during the early 1900s when Progressive and \"regular\" Republicans were at loggerheads, may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion. Among the variable strategies available to the minority party, which can vary from bill to bill and be used in combination or at different stages of the lawmaking process, are the following:\\nDoes dissension and cohesion of majority party factor into minority strategy?\\nThe answer is the following: may provide the minority leader with greater opportunities to achieve his or her priorities than if the majority party exhibited high degrees of party cohesion\\nIn the midst of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland\\'s Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, \"I will probably be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become Europe\\'s indispensable nation.\" According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany\\'s history. \"This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin\\'s position at the center of the Continent.\" Heilbrunn believes that the adage, \"what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union\" has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany\\'s national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany\\'s conspicuous position as Europe\\'s strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski\\'s effusive praise for his country\\'s western neighbor.

In this view, phonology is based on a set of universal phonological processes that interact with one another; which ones are active and which are suppressed is language-specific. Rather than acting on segments, phonological processes act on distinctive features within prosodic groups. Prosodic groups can be as small as a part of a syllable or as large as an entire utterance. Phonological processes are unordered with respect to each other and apply simultaneously (though the output of one process may be the input to another). The second most prominent natural phonologist is Patricia Donegan (Stampe\\'s wife); there are many natural phonologists in Europe, and a few in the U.S., such as Geoffrey Nathan. The principles of natural phonology were extended to morphology by Wolfgang U. Dressler, who founded natural morphology.\\n\\nNow answer this question: Who is the number two natural phonologist?  \\n\\nOutput: Patricia Donegan\\nArticle: Although the etymology of the name has been studied since the 7th century by authors like Isidore of Seville —who wrote that \"Galicians are called so, because of their fair skin, as the Gauls\", relating the name to the Greek word for milk—, currently scholars derive the name of the ancient Callaeci either from Proto-Indo-European *kal-n-eH2 \\'hill\\', through a local relational suffix -aik-, so meaning \\'the hill (people)\\'; or either from Proto-Celtic *kallī- \\'forest\\', so meaning \\'the forest (people)\\'. In any case, Galicia, being per se a derivation of the ethnic name Kallaikói, would mean \\'the land of the Galicians\\'.\\n\\nQuestion: Which original ethnic name is \"Galicia\" derived from?\\nAns: Kallaikói\\nInput: Compact disc\\nReplicated CDs are mass-produced initially using a hydraulic press. Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are fed into the press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic into the mold cavity. The mold closes with a metal stamper in contact with the disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm, and a 15 mm diameter center hole (called a stacking ring) is created. The time it takes to \"stamp\" one CD is usually two to three seconds.\\n\\nHow are CDs mass produced?\\nOutput:'},\n",

Jennifer Lawrence\\'s publicity team called the alleged pictures of the Oscar winner \"a flagrant violation of privacy\" and promised prosecution, while Mary Elizabeth Winstead said on Twitter that photos of her were ones the singer and actress thought she\\'d deleted herself.\\n\\nRead MoreApple says it is \\'actively investigating\\' celeb photo hack\\n\\nThe FBI said Monday it\\'s \"aware of the allegations concerning computer intrusions and the unlawful release of material involving high profile individuals, and is addressing the matter.\" Meanwhile, Apple Inc. — whose cloud storage service many of the photos appeared to have come from — said it\\'s \"actively investigating\" the claims.\\n\\nThat hasn\\'t been nailed down, but there are three main theories. One is what\\'s known as a social engineering attack — the hacker or hackers simply \"guessed a celeb\\'s password or got it from a friend,\" Howe said.\\n\\nThe second theory involves what\\'s called a brute-force attack. Announcement of the leak came very quickly after a team of developers revealed on tech forums that they\\'d found a bug in Apple\\'s Find My iPhone service allowing anybody who learns your username to simply keep entering hundreds or thousands of passwords until he hits Bingo.\\n\\nBut \"I think it\\'s safe to say that this was not done with a brute force hacking tool,\" Moorhead said as further details of the photos emerged Monday, including data that indicated they were squirreled away not just on iCloud, but also on other popular online storage services.\\n\\nThe theory of Moorhead and several other experts consulted by NBC News is that the alleged hack probably started somewhere else, likely on an e-commerce site — somewhere \"where somebody used the same login for another service where other photos were kept,\" Moorhead said. Once the hacker had an email address and either a username or a password, he or she could have gone to any one of a number of sites and used the \"forgot my login\" feature to get access to that site — and very likely several other sites, because the painful truth is that most people use the same login information for most of their online activities, security experts said.\\n\\nMillions of people and companies upload their most sensitive data to services like iCloud and Dropbox in \"the cloud\" — enormous online servers that you access as though they were your own hard drive. That way, \"you can always have a backup if your computer is lost or stolen,\" said Mark Rasch of Rasch Technology and Cyberlaw, who\\'s a former director of the Justice Department\\'s Computer Crime Unit.\\n\\nsummary: The celebrity photo hack highlights that our faith in Internet security isn\\'t always answered.

Considering user feedback surrounding the inclusion of ads or even the newsfeed, I’m not too sure how the users will feel about an ad network being tied up with any applications. After malware was found on a Facebook Flyer ad, everyone will need to be more aware of potential security issues that applications and ads could bring about. Regardless of user and security issues, having a Facebook app ad network sounds like something marketers could be excited about, as everyone figures out how to best leverage and monetize these applications.\\n\\nsummary:'},\n",

The food has always been awesome, but the last three times I'd been here, the service was beyond abysmal.

So I was pleasantly surprised on my last visit.  We were told the table would be 10-15 minutes; we were seated in five.  Iced tea and water never reached empty.  And the food was incredible, as always.  I'm not much of a fish-eater, so I can't reliably rate their sushi, but I've always loved what I've had here. The Chicken Katsu is also very good.

She brought my tea, but no sweetner, so I grabbed a couple of packets of a table behind me. It was at least 10 minutes before she came back to take my order and there were no other people at the bar. She never told me her name. I ordered the Baja Burger with a chicken breast and she asked me how I wanted it cooked. Hmmm My food came, the sweet potato fries were good. The bun was dense and dry and I took it off and only ate the chicken and avocado with a fork and knife.  When she came back I told her that I didn't like the bun. She seemed uninterested. I asked for my bill. She brought it, right away, but didn't pay any attention when I wanted to pay and leave. About 6 people came in and she waited on them, and I kept trying to get her to cash me out so I could leave.  I'm done with this Gallagher's. They just keep getting worse.

Va Bene is an upscale (read: no base ball hats) wine bar that has a full bar, a dance floor and a stage! The decor is very classy with deep red long velvet drapes. Seating is around the HUGE bar, tall tables that seat 4 with white tablecloths and intimate booths (yes, IN THE BAR!)  They have great outdoor patio space on 2 sides of the restaurant with heat lamps in the winter and a nice counter height fire pit.  Va Bene hosts the best bands around like The Soul Solution (these girls can SING!!) and the sax player Todd is amazing!) and Contra Band. The bartenders and wait staff are friendly and make really great drinks. Try the Chocolatini!  The crowd is a high energy, great mix of everyone and it can get quite crowded between 9 and 11pm. You will see anything from sequins to nice jeans to suits.  FYI  The 2 corner bar seats on the left are reserved for my friend Kiki and I when the Soul Solution is playing.

       "    'content': 'Summarize the following:\\nSoak a cotton ball with nail polish remover and gently rub the cotton ball on the surface of the nail. Keep rubbing until you see that the polish is completely removed. You may need to use a bit of pressure to remove the polish entirely. Grab a bowl or plastic container large enough to place both of your feet inside. Fill it with warm water, taking care that it is not too hot that you could burn yourself. Stir in a cup of Epsom salts, which can be obtained at any grocery store in your area. Take a minute to enjoy the warmth of the water on your feet and relax. A pumice stone is used to gently slough off rough spots, making your feet nice and soft. Hold it firmly in one hand and use your free hand to hold your foot. Rub the pumice stone gently in one direction over any rough spots or calluses. You can use some pressure but it is not necessary to use a lot; the surface of the stone will take care of removing the rough skin. When finished with the pumice stone, rub your favorite softening lotion into your feet and legs to create soft, silky skin. Squirt a quarter-sized amount of lotion into the palm of your hands, then rub your hands together and begin applying the lotion to your legs. Rub your skin until the lotion has absorbed into the skin. Use a cuticle trimmer to cut off hangnails and dead skin around the beds of the nails. A cuticle trimmer will allow you to eliminate the dead skin without damaging the live tissue. Use with caution, as these are very sharp tools.  Snip hangnails, which are the bits of dead skin that hang off the area of skin close the bed of the nail. Cut as close to the base of the hangnail as possible without damaging the live skin. Trim any cuticles that are beginning to lift away from the nail bed. These are generally lighter in color than your natural skin and can be easily noticeable. Be careful not to cut too deep with the cuticle trimmer, as you could end up bleeding. If this happens, put pressure on the area for a few minutes and and apply a bandage.\\n\\nsummary: Remove any existing nail polish. Soak your feet in hot water. Use a pumice stone. Rub lotion into your feet. Trim the cuticles.\\n\\n\\nSummarize the following:\\nThis is key, otherwise the tires might lock up and not spin properly. Put your key in the ignition, and turn to start your car. While your car is still in park, turn off traction control. There is generally a button on the left or right side of the steering wheel allowing you to disable traction control. See your owner\\'s manual if there is no such button.  Do not turn off traction control before you start your car. The default setting for traction control is \"ON.\" This means that traction control will turn on after the ignition starts. A light is likely to appear on your dashboard above your steering wheel calling your attention to the fact that traction control has been turned off. Do not worry about this light, as it will disappear once you finish spinning donuts, and turn traction control back on. The surface of the space should ideally be blacktop rather than grass or dirt. It is best to spin donuts on a barren parking lot, or back road. Make sure that you have enough space, not just for your car, but for when it begins to spin in circles. You should also make sure that the surrounding space does not have any houses, trees, or other obstructions. Though you can also do donuts in snowy areas, avoid icy or slick areas as these can present a safety hazard. You do not want to spin donuts with tires that are already worn down, and/or need replacing. To check the tread, perform the \"penny test.\" Take a penny and place it in one of the tire\\'s tread ribs. Make sure Lincoln\\'s head is facing down. If the tread rib covers the entire head, you have enough tread on your tire to safely spin donuts. If the head is more than halfway showing, you should think about replacing your tires. You can either do this yourself by purchasing tires online or visiting your nearest car care professional. Make sure that your oil has been recently changed. You should also change your power steering and brake fluids. These are critically important, as spinning donuts puts a tremendous amount of pressure on your car. You need to make sure it is in top shape before you take it out. Please visit your nearest car care professional or use the following links to change your car\\'s fluids:  How to Change the Oil in Your Car How to Flush Power Steering Fluid How to Refill Brake Fluid You should also perform an overall check on your car\\'s mechanical components. Check your engine, transmission, muffler, etc. to make sure they are in tip-top shape. Visit: How to Do a Maintenance Inspection for Your Car. Generally speaking, spinning donuts is safe. However, in case of an emergency, you should always have people on standby. This could be a couple of friends or relatives who are willing to go out with you. Have them stand far away from where you are spinning donuts. This way there is no chance that they can get hurt, and therefore, will be able to call someone in case of an emergency.  Make sure your phone is charged before you go out, as well as your friends\\' phones. Have your local sheriff\\'s office and emergency personnel phone numbers on hand in the event of an emergency.\\n\\nsummary: Turn off the traction control on your car before you do any donuts.

Is the development of AI like “summoning the demon,” as tech pioneer Elon Musk told an audience at MIT in October? Will smart machines supersede or even annihilate humankind?\\n\\nAs a cognitive scientist and founder of a new startup that focuses on “machine learning,” I think about these questions nearly every day.\\n\\nBut let’s not panic. “Superintelligent” machines won’t be arriving soon. Computers today are good at narrow tasks carefully engineered by programmers, like balancing checkbooks and landing airplanes, but after five decades of research, they are still weak at anything that looks remotely like genuine human intelligence.\\n\\nEven the best computer programs out there lack the flexibility of human thinking. A teenager can pick up a new videogame in an hour; your average computer program still can only do just the single task for which it was designed. (Some new technologies do slightly better, but they still struggle with any task that requires long-term planning.)\\n\\nA more immediate concern is that a machine doesn’t have to be superintelligent to do a lot of damage, if it is sufficiently empowered. Stock market flash crashes are one example: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost in minutes as a result of minor, difficult-to-completely-eliminate bugs.\\n\\nThe clear and present danger, if not the greatest long-term danger, is that mediocre computer programs can cause significant damage if left unchecked. What will happen, for example, when nearly perfect—but still imperfect—software controls not just stock trades but driverless cars? It’s one thing for a software bug to trash your grocery list; it’s another for it to crash your car.\\n\\nNone of this means that we should abandon research in artificial intelligence. Driverless cars probably will cause some fatalities, but they also will avert tens of thousands of deaths. Robotic doctors (perhaps a couple of decades away) may occasionally make bad calls, but they will also bring high-quality medicine to places that would otherwise lack trained doctors. Banning AI could squander a chance to save or radically enhance millions of lives.\\n\\nStill, the scalability of AI—a single program can be replicated millions of times—means that each new program carries risks if it has access to the outside world. The more autonomy that we give to machines, the more we need to have safeguards in place. A program “sandboxed” on your iPhone, with no real access to the outside world, isn’t of much concern. A program that places stock trades needs more safeguards. A general-purpose robot that lives in your home, with full access to the Internet, would need vastly more.\\n\\nThe trouble is, nobody yet knows what that oversight should consist of. Though AI poses no immediate existential threat, nobody in the private sector or government has a long-term solution to its potential dangers. Until we have some mechanism for guaranteeing that machines never try to replace us, or relegate us to zoos, we should take the problem of AI risk seriously.\\n\\nComputers have become much better at many things over the last decades, from chess to arithmetic to network trafficking, but so far they have not shown the slightest interest in us or our possessions. If this remains the case, there is every reason to think that they will continue to be our partners rather than our conquerors. We could be worried about nothing.\\n\\nBut the alarmists have a point, too. The real problem isn’t that world domination automatically follows from sufficiently increased machine intelligence; it is that we have absolutely no way, so far, of predicting or regulating what comes next. Should we demand transparency in programs that control important resources? Fund advances in techniques for “program verification,” which tries to make sure that programs do what they are designed to do? Outlaw certain specific, risky applications?\\n\\nFor now, anyone can write virtually any program at any time, and we have scarcely any infrastructure in place to predict or control the results. And that is a real reason for worry.\\n\\n—Dr. Marcus is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at New York University and CEO of Geometric Intelligence.

I was hungry and just wanted something to eat. As we looked through the menu, everything was a bit expensive with only a few affordable options. The only thing I was craving for was for some chili cheese fries and they had it.  Minus one star because our waiter was rushing our order and was completely rude. They need to check their waiters before they wait tables. I don't tolerate that rude customer service shit.  Minus one star because mine and my boyfriends water had debris floating around on the bottom. After asking for new water, the second two cups also had debris floating around. I figured it was just something maybe in the ice, so I only drank the water on top with a straw.  Minus another star because this restaurant is located in the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.

       "    'content': 'Problem: Violence rocked two major Iraqi cities Wednesday, including Baghdad, where a car bombing near a wedding party and two other bombings killed at least 20 people, police said. In Mosul, a Sunni activist known to demonstrate against Iraq\\'s Shiite-led government was assassinated, one of 10 people killed or found dead from acts of violence Wednesday in the northern Iraqi city, Mosul police officials said. The slayings come amid an uptick of political and sectarian violence across Iraq, where more than 350 people died in acts of violence in May, according to a CNN tally. And Wednesday\\'s attacks come on what is becoming an especially deadly week in the country -- at least 110 people have been killed since Monday. In Baghdad, two car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded in separate Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad within 30 minutes of each other Wednesday evening, police in the Iraqi capital said. One of the car bombs detonated near a wedding party in al-Diwan, a neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, killing at least 16 people and wounding 42 others, according to police. It wasn\\'t clear whether the wedding party involved Sunnis or Shiites. The other car bomb exploded in a market in the al-Gazaliya neighborhood in western Baghdad, killing four people and wounding 17 others, police said. And in the al-Khadraa neighborhood in western Baghdad, a roadside bomb wounded six people, police said. Meanwhile, Wednesday\\'s killings in Mosul -- about 430 kilometers (265 miles) north of Baghdad -- were another sign of a shaky security situation in Nineveh, the province where Mosul is located and one of three Iraqi provinces that postponed April\\'s provincial council elections until July because of violence. Gunmen fatally shot Sunni activist Sheikh Hassan al-Jabouri with pistols equipped with silencers in central Mosul, a predominantly Sunni city, police said. No suspects have been announced. Al-Jabouri was active in demonstrations demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what protesters call second-class treatment of Iraq\\'s Sunni community. Since December, tens of thousands of such demonstrators have taken to the streets across Iraq. Sunni Arabs had more political clout in Iraq during Saddam Hussein\\'s rule, until his government was deposed in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion. Under the Shiite-led government in the post-Saddam era, Sunnis have felt marginalized. About two-thirds of Iraq\\'s nearly 32 million people are Shiite and roughly a third are Sunni, according to the CIA World Factbook. Also Wednesday, a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb at a police station in southern Mosul, killing two people and wounding seven others, police said. And the bodies of three people who appeared to have been tortured and hanged were recovered from the Tigris River and sent to the Mosul morgue, police said. The hanging victims appeared to have died Wednesday morning, police said. They have not been identified. Also, Iraqi federal police killed four people in clashes with unspecified gunmen in eastern Mosul, police officials in the city said. The clashes happened after people reported suspicious activity in a building. When police arrived, gunmen emerged and attacked them, the Mosul police officials said. In other violence Wednesday, mortar rounds landed on offices of the Nineveh provincial council in central Mosul, wounding six people, according to police. Wednesday\\'s bloodshed comes amid an increase of violence across Iraq, much of it stemming from discord between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. On Tuesday, at least 23 people were killed and more than 80 others were wounded in three explosions and three shooting incidents in Baghdad and Mosul, police officials said. On Monday, at least 57 people were killed and 190 wounded in a wave of attacks in Baghdad and other cities, police said. READ MORE: Iraq at crossroads as bombs explode.

Diwali -- from the word Deepavali, meaning \"row of lights\" -- is observed by Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities, who celebrate for five days in autumn to mark the victory of light over darkness. This year, the festival begins on November 3, with splashes of color, lighting displays and blaring parties set to greet Diwali\\'s arrival. Celebrated for centuries across much of the Indian subcontinent, Diwali is now exploding: spreading the promise of wealth, knowledge and happiness to new communities across the world. From India. For the Diwali newcomer, photographer Roy del Vecchio expertly captures the outsider\\'s inauguration into the festival -- snapping the delighted face of a man who had invited him to join the celebrations on his roof. 39-year-old del Vecchio says he had traveled to Rajasthan to see the festival, when the man holding the sparkler had invited to join him and his sons to light fireworks and share traditional sweets. More CNN Celebrates: Halloween -- Some of you are pretty twisted. Fireworks are said to drive away evil spirits and, at this time of year, many Hindus will also clean the house and light small oil-burning lanterns to attract Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth into the home. But the celebration is anticipated with excitement by many across India -- as well as neighboring Sri Lanka and Nepal -- regardless of religious beliefs. \"I do celebrate Diwali, more for the spirit of the festival, rather than its religious implications,\" says iReporter Samarjit Mazumdar from Bangalore, India. To the World. Mazumdar captured one of Diwali\\'s traditional symbols: a Swastika assembled from marigold flowers, which symbolizes peace, the 32-year-old explains. But this year\\'s celebrations are likely to be anything but peaceful, with an explosion of Diwali parties lighting up cities across the world. Recent years have seen Diwali parties pop up in locations from Ontario, Canada to Melbourne, Australia, where traditional Diwali celebrations mix with showcases for Indian food, music, dance, and film. From Singapore\\'s Little India district to rural Somerset, UK, iReporters have sent pictures of Diwali lights shining out. Meanwhile in Guyana, a huge motorcade rolls through the capital Georgetown -- as captured by Guyana native Amanda Richards. The country\\'s 200,000-strong Hindu population line the route and often wait for hours to see the parade pass by. Richards says she\\'s already planning where she\\'ll go to wait for this year\\'s motorcade -- and join the millions of others across the world hoping to catch a glimpse of the lights.\\n\\nWhat are highlight points?\\nAnswer:'},\n",

This match-up would see two 10-1 teams face one another for the first time since 1990 when the New York Giants lost to the San Francisco 49ers. Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo faced off against his boyhood idol Brett Favre in the game. The Packers started the game missing two key players of their defense, with injured cornerback Charles Woodson (tied for 7th in the NFL with 4 interceptions) and pass-rushing end Kabeer Gbaja-Biamila (tied for 6th in the NFL with 9.5 sacks) on the inactive list. In the first quarter, Green Bay took the early lead as rookie kicker Mason Crosby completed a 47-yard field goal. On the first play of the Cowboys opening drive, Al Harris stripped the ball from Terrell Owens and side judge Laird Hayes signaled Green Bay ball, but head linesman Derick Bowers overruled him. The only option for Mike McCarthy to challenge on the play, since the whistle was blown, was whether it was a reception - the strip could not be reviewed. The replay upheld the reception and Dallas retained possession.  Nick Folk completed a 26-yard field goal to tie the game. Folk also completed a 51-yard field goal, and QB Tony Romo threw a 3-yard TD pass to WR Patrick Crayton. The Packers would end the first quarter with rookie RB Ryan Grant running for a 62-yard touchdown. In the second quarter, Dallas responded with Romo completing a 26-yard TD pass to TE Anthony Fasano and a 10-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens.  Brett Favre left the game in the second quarter after he hit his right elbow on the helmet of a blitzing Cowboys DB Nate Jones. The throw led to Favre's second interception. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers took over for the Packers next series and led the offense on a 74-yard drive, capping it off with an 11-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings. In the third, Grant finished off a 69-yard Packer drive with a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the quarter. In the fourth quarter, Romo completed a 4-yard TD pass to Crayton. Mason Crosby kicked a 52-yard field goal with just over 5&#160;minutes remaining in the game to pull the Packers within a field goal. Dallas sealed the win as Folk kicked a 25-yard field goal with 1:03 left in the game. The Packers were flagged for a season-high 142 penalty yards.\\n\\nQuestion: Write an article that answers the following question: How many yards was Manning's longest touchdown pass?\\nArticle: Game SummaryWith their championship title to defend, the Colts began the season in the annual Thursday night kickoff game against the visiting New Orleans Saints.  In the first quarter, Indianapolis began their year with Super Bowl MVP QB Peyton Manning completing a 27-yard TD pass to WR Marvin Harrison for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Saints would get their only touchdown of the game with former Colts DB Jason David returning a fumble 55&#160;yards, while kicker Olindo Mare would get a 34-yard field goal.  Indianapolis ended the first half with kicker Adam Vinatieri kicking a 33-yard field goal.  In the second half, the Colts took control for the rest of the game.  During the third quarter, RB Joseph Addai got a 2-yard TD run, while Manning hooked up with WR Reggie Wayne on a 28-yard touchdown pass.  In the fourth quarter, Indianapolis sealed the victory with Vinatieri getting a 33-yard field goal, Manning & Wayne hooking up with each other again on a 45-yard TD pass, and DB Matt Giordano returning an interception 83&#160;yards for a touchdown.\\n\\nQuestion: Write an article that answers the following question: Who threw the shortest touchdown pass of the game?\\nArticle: Hoping to rebound from their overtime road loss to the Browns, the Seahawks went home for an NFC West rematch on Monday Night Football with the San Francisco 49ers.

In the second quarter, the Seahawks increased their lead with RB Maurice Morris getting a 6-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle sealed the victory and the season-sweep in the fourth quarter with Hasselbeck completing a 10-yard TD pass.

All last week, the musings of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other European leaders put the markets on edge. “You are almost forced to get up and watch the goings-on,” he added.\\n\\nThe nest of night owls is growing more crowded. Senior executives at the Pacific Investment Management Company, the giant bond-trading house, wake up at 1 a.m. in Southern California, to check their BlackBerrys for updates from colleagues in Europe.\\n\\n“Your nerves are twitching,” said Christian Stracke, Pimco’s global head of credit research.\\n\\nMichael Mayo, a longtime bank stock analyst, said he was working the lobster shift so often just to keep up with the latest International Monetary Fund rescue or Slovenian parliamentary vote that he might as well call himself a 24-hour-a-day research shop. “Who would have thought we would have to be looking at Italian sovereign debt yields to figure out what Morgan Stanley’s stock will do?” he said.\\n\\nFor traders, there is too much to lose if they sleep through history.\\n\\nThat’s why Craig Gorman, a partner at First New York Securities, routinely monitors his trading positions in the middle of the night. He turns on CNBC and fires up the Bloomberg terminal with six screens at the foot of his bed. “With the TV and all my monitors on, it gets a little bright in there,” he said. “My wife is not thrilled about it.”\\n\\nThe other downside? It is hard to fall back asleep once the adrenaline from trading starts pumping. Even so, Mr. Gorman said it was worth the price: “You can’t get the same feel for market psychology looking back at the charts in the morning as when you are up,” he added.\\n\\nNews organizations and brokerage firms see an uptick in early-morning activity, too. Bloomberg reports at least a 30 percent jump from a year ago in the use of its mobile applications, which allow customers to remotely log into the trading terminal at their office desk. The biggest spikes have occurred well before the New York markets open, between 5 and 7 a.m., when traders wake up and commute to work, as well as between midnight and 3 a.m., when trading in Asia winds down and the European markets open, according to company officials.\\n\\nCNBC has recorded a 50 percent increase in the tiny audience watching “Worldwide Exchange,” which broadcasts between 4 and 6 a.m. Traffic on its Web site between 2 and 5 a.m. has risen about 30 percent compared with a year ago.\\n\\nThere are also signs that predawn trading by American retail investors has increased. TD Ameritrade, which caters to individual investors, said customer trading volume in S.& P. futures — a bet on the coming day’s direction in the market — has more than doubled between 3 and 6 a.m. over the last year.\\n\\nWall Street has long been the land of the early riser, and plenty of fixations in high finance have come and gone. In the late 1970s and 1980s, traders obsessed over the state of the money supply; in the late 1990s, they focused on rapidly rising Web page views of the leading dot-com companies. Last year, traders acted like armchair engineers in deep-water drilling as they monitored images of the BP oil spill gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nWhether or not Europe’s new plan struck on Friday to achieve budgetary discipline brings market stability, some suggest that the current middle-of-the-night frenzy heralds a lasting change for an industry that coined the term “bankers’ hours.”\\n\\n“It is now making people aware that they can become a global trader,” said J. J. Kinahan, the chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade. “They don’t have to rely on the hours of the New York Stock Exchange” between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern time.\\n\\nSeveral forces are at play. The convergence of mobile technology and financial information allows investors to trade on news — anywhere, anytime. The markets, meanwhile, have grown so interconnected that what happens with sovereign bonds can quickly affect equities.\\n\\nAny whiff of trouble in Europe can send markets into a tailspin and easily overwhelm the hard-earned edge a trader might have gained by digging deep into the financials of an individual stock.\\n\\n“The degree to which asset prices are connected is off the charts,” said Dean Curnutt, the president of Macro Risk Advisors and another early riser.\\n\\nThat is the main reason that Brad Alford, the chief investment officer of Alpha Capital in Atlanta, rolls over in bed, grabs his iPad and glances at the Bloomberg market feeds with one eye, sometimes two, before the sun comes up. Or why Mr. Kass trudges over to his poolside home office in Palm Beach, Fla., to e-mail hedge fund friends about the latest troubled country du jour. “There is a pretty active cabal in those early hours,” he said.\\n\\nIt is also why Al Moniz, a European bond fund manager at Fore Research and Management in New York, has been waking up at 2 a.m. at least several times a month, and expects even more bleary-eyed nights next year.\\n\\n“It is probably going to get worse,” he said. “I don’t think there is any end in sight.”\\nWhat was this article about?\\n++++++++++\\nIt\\'s about:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Question: Norman Ernest Borlaug (March 25, 1914 - September 12, 2009) was an American agronomist and humanitarian who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. Borlaug received his B.Sc. in Forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the University of Minnesota in 1942.\\n\\nBorlaug\\'s name is nearly synonymous with the Green Revolution, against which many criticisms have been mounted over the decades by environmentalists and some nutritionalists. Throughout his years of research, Borlaug\\'s programs often faced opposition by people who consider genetic crossbreeding to be unnatural or to have negative effects. Borlaug\\'s work has been criticized for bringing large-scale monoculture, input-intensive farming techniques to countries that had previously relied on subsistence farming. These farming techniques often reap large profits for U.S. agribusiness and agrochemical corporations and have been criticized for widening social inequality in the countries owing to uneven food distribution while forcing a capitalist agenda of U.S. corporations onto countries that had undergone land reform.  Other concerns of his critics and critics of biotechnology in general include: that the construction of roads in populated third-world areas could lead to the destruction of wilderness; the crossing of genetic barriers; the inability of crops to fulfill all nutritional requirements; the decreased biodiversity from planting a small number of varieties; the environmental and economic effects of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides; the amount of herbicide sprayed on fields of herbicide-resistant crops.  Borlaug dismissed most claims of critics, but did take certain concerns seriously. He stated that his work has been \"a change in the right direction, but it has not transformed the world into a Utopia\". Of environmental lobbyists he stated, \"some of the environmental lobbyists of the Western nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are elitists. They\\'ve never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in Washington or Brussels. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they\\'d be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things\".\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Why was Borlaug criticized?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer: Borlaug\\'s name is nearly synonymous with the Green Revolution, against which many criticisms have been mounted over the decades by environmentalists and some nutritionalists.\\n\\n\\nQuestion: Cleese was born in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, the only child of Reginald Francis Cleese (1893-1972), an insurance salesman, and his wife Muriel Evelyn (nee Cross; 1899-2000). His family\\'s surname was originally Cheese, but his father had thought it was embarrassing and changed it when he enlisted in the Army during the First World War. As a child, Cleese supported Bristol City FC and Somerset County Cricket Club. Cleese was educated at St Peter\\'s Preparatory School, where he received a prize for English and did well at cricket and boxing.\\n\\nAlong with Gilliam\\'s animations, Cleese\\'s work with Graham Chapman provided Python with its darkest and angriest moments, and many of his characters display the seething suppressed rage that later characterised his portrayal of Basil Fawlty.  Unlike Palin and Jones, Cleese and Chapman wrote together in the same room; Cleese claims that their writing partnership involved Cleese doing most of the work, while Chapman sat back, not speaking for long periods before suddenly coming out with an idea that often elevated the sketch to a new level. A classic example of this is the \"Dead Parrot sketch\", envisaged by Cleese as a satire on poor customer service, which was originally to have involved a broken toaster and later a broken car (this version was actually performed and broadcast on the pre-Python special How to Irritate People). It was Chapman\\'s suggestion to change the faulty item into a dead parrot, and he also suggested that the parrot be specifically a \"Norwegian Blue\", giving the sketch a surreal air which made it far more memorable.  Their humour often involved ordinary people in ordinary situations behaving absurdly for no obvious reason. Like Chapman, Cleese\\'s poker face, clipped middle class accent, and intimidating height allowed him to appear convincingly as a variety of authority figures, such as policemen, detectives, Nazi officers or government officials--which he would then proceed to undermine. Most famously, in the \"Ministry of Silly Walks\" sketch (actually written by Palin and Jones), Cleese exploits his stature as the crane-legged civil servant performing a grotesquely elaborate walk to his office.  Chapman and Cleese also specialised in sketches where two characters would conduct highly articulate arguments over completely arbitrary subjects, such as in the \"cheese shop\", the \"dead parrot\" sketch and \"Argument Clinic\", where Cleese plays a stone-faced bureaucrat employed to sit behind a desk and engage people in pointless, trivial bickering. All of these roles were opposite Palin (who Cleese often claims is his favourite Python to work with)--the comic contrast between the towering Cleese\\'s crazed aggression and the shorter Palin\\'s shuffling inoffensiveness is a common feature in the series. Occasionally, the typical Cleese-Palin dynamic is reversed, as in \"Fish Licence\", wherein Palin plays the bureaucrat with whom Cleese is trying to work.  Though the programme lasted four series, by the start of series 3, Cleese was growing tired of dealing with Chapman\\'s alcoholism. He felt, too, that the show\\'s scripts had declined in quality. For these reasons, he became restless and decided to move on. Though he stayed for the third series, he officially left the group before the fourth season. Despite this, he remained friendly with the group, and all six began writing Monty Python and the Holy Grail; Cleese received a credit on three episodes of the fourth series which used material from these sessions, though he was officially unconnected with the fourth series. Cleese returned to the troupe to co-write and co-star in the Monty Python films Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Monty Python\\'s Life of Brian and Monty Python\\'s The Meaning of Life, and participated in various live performances over the years.\\n\\nUsing a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What is another work that they did together?\\nHHHHHH\\nAnswer:'},\n",

       "    'content': 'Use a reel mower to keep the grass short where the weeds tend to grow. The spurge will not be able to move in as easily if you keep your lawn dense, short, and healthy. Before the grass and weeds start to grow, fertilize your lawn and water for 30 minutes afterward. Fertilizing the lawn will help produce healthier grass, which is a way to prevent weeds from spreading. If you are trying to control spurge in an area outside of a lawn or turf area, do not fertilize. The grass will probably not be maintained and fertilizing the area will only help the weed grow faster. Maintaining a healthy lawn or mulched area is the first defense against controlling spurge. Water the lawn for 30 minutes. Test to make sure the grass has enough water by trying to push a screwdriver into the dirt. If it sinks easily to 6\\xa0in (15\\xa0cm), do not continue to water it. If not, water for another 10 minutes and retest.  Depending on the type of grass you have, it may be more heat and drought-resistant than others. Also, if you live a dry climate, you will need to water your grass more often.\\n\\nSummary: Mow the grass so it stays below 2\\xa0in (5.1\\xa0cm). Fertilize your lawn during spring months (April-May). Water your lawn to maintain healthy grass.\\n\\n\\nYour knee-jerk response to being asked for a favor may be to say \"Yes.\" Make a habit of not giving an automatic \"Yes\" all the time. When asked to do something, instead respond with, \"I\\'ll think about it\" or \"Can I get back to you on that? I\\'d like to, but I might have something scheduled.\"  Saying \"I\\'ll think about it\" will usually get the person off your back. This will give you time to genuinely consider your response. After agreeing to think something over, you can decide later whether or not you agree. If you decide against doing something, you can give a firm \"No\" later. For example, a friend asks if you\\'ll watch her cat over the holiday weekend. Say, \"I have to look over my schedule. Let me think about it.\" While you should be firm when saying \"No,\" you\\'ll also feel better if you\\'re polite. When letting someone down, soften the blow by starting with a compliment. Express gratitude at having been asked or invited. For example, \"I\\'m glad you feel comfortable asking me to watch Bella. It means a lot knowing that you trust me with your cat because I know how much you care about her.\" \" After the initial kindness, you can say \"No.\" Be firm here. You want to make it clear you are giving a firm \"No\" so the person does not press the issue or ask you again. For example, \"I just don\\'t really have the time to run back and forth from your place this weekend. I already have a lot of plans with family.\" You want to leave things on a good note. You can be firm without being rude or aggressive. Thank the person for thinking of you, and wish them good luck. For example, \"Again, I\\'m glad to know you trust me with Bella. Good luck finding someone else to watch her.\"\\n\\nSummary: Ask for more time before committing. Start with a compliment or gratitude. Give a clear \"No. Thank and encourage the person.\\n\\n\\nThis method does not require quite as much time as a full unraveling, but it will be more time-consuming than cutting your locks out. Depending on how many locks you have, how old the locks are, and how much of your hair you intend to keep, this process could take anywhere from 2 to 15 hours. The exact length is yours to decide, but typically, you should plan on saving at least 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) to make this method worth the time. This method works best if you want to keep some of your hair but have locks older than four years. When you\\'ve had locks for more than four years, it is best to cut off half of your hair or more before trying to unlock the rest. Use barber scissors to cut each dread one at a time, keeping roughly the same amount of each one intact. Fill a bucket or sink with warm water. Sit in front of the water and tip your head back, submerging as many of your locks as possible. For best results, try to soak your locks for 5 to 10 minutes. Any amount of soaking time is better than none, though. Work detangling shampoo into your locks, scrubbing it in thoroughly using your fingers. Use hot water during this process, as well.  The water should be hot, but not hot enough to burn your scalp or fingers. Washing your hair should help remove some of the build-up that would otherwise interfere with the unlocking process. Rinse the shampoo out of your locks before continuing. Rub a little conditioner or specialized lock removal product into each lock, working with them one by one. Do not rinse the conditioner out of your hair after applying it. Pierce the bottom of the lock with the tail or teeth of a metal comb. Use the comb to pick out loops and tangles within each lock.  Start at the bottom and gradually work your way up the rest of the lock. Comb out the loosened hair after every 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so. Repeat this process on each dread, working one at a time, until all the locks have been undone. After undoing your locks, apply conditioner to your hair again.  Let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing it out with warm water. The extra conditioner you apply now should help repair damage to your hair. Brush out the loosened hair and carefully trim the ends to balance out the entire style. Note that it might be easiest to do this while your hair is still wet. Dry your hair after tidying it up, not before. Your hair may seem frizzy and unhealthy at first, but if you wash it regularly and apply conditioner after each wash, it should become notably healthier within a week or two.\\n\\nSummary: Set aside enough time. Determine how long to leave the hair. Cut the dreads at an even position. Soak the remaining locks. Wash well. Condition the remaining locks. Pick out each lock one by one. Condition once more. Trim uneven ends. Care for your hair.\\n\\n\\nYou can use your fingers, a cotton ball or pad, a washcloth — it doesn’t really matter. Don\\'t apply so much that it drips down your face. If you do this in the morning, just go about your day normally at home, or go out with the oil and stain on your face if you’re confident enough! If you do this at night, go ahead sleep with the baby oil on your face. This will help you remove the stain in the morning. Cover the stained area with gauze bandages or cotton balls and athletic tape to make sure the oil and dye don’t get all over your pillows and sheets while you sleep. Use your hands or a washcloth to gently scrub the stain away.\\n\\n'},\n",

Although relations between the Portuguese state and the Roman Catholic Church were generally amiable and stable since the earliest years of the Portuguese nation, their relative power fluctuated. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the church enjoyed both riches and power stemming from its role in the reconquest, its close identification with early Portuguese nationalism and the foundation of the Portuguese educational system, including the first university. The growth of the Portuguese overseas empire made its missionaries important agents of colonization, with important roles in the education and evangelization of people from all the inhabited continents. The growth of liberal and nascent republican movements during the eras leading to the formation of the First Portuguese Republic (1910–26) changed the role and importance of organized religion.\\nIn what religion do many Portuguese holidays and festivals find their origin?\\nA: Christian\\n\\nContext and question: Rather than just using a thick tube, there are similar techniques used to the same effect such as replacing thin wire elements with cages to simulate a thicker element. This widens the bandwidth of the resonance. On the other hand, amateur radio antennas need to operate over several bands which are widely separated from each other. This can often be accomplished simply by connecting resonant elements for the different bands in parallel. Most of the transmitter\\'s power will flow into the resonant element while the others present a high (reactive) impedance and draw little current from the same voltage. A popular solution uses so-called traps consisting of parallel resonant circuits which are strategically placed in breaks along each antenna element. When used at one particular frequency band the trap presents a very high impedance (parallel resonance) effectively truncating the element at that length, making it a proper resonant antenna. At a lower frequency the trap allows the full length of the element to be employed, albeit with a shifted resonant frequency due to the inclusion of the trap\\'s net reactance at that lower frequency.\\nHow could one achieve the task of creating an antenna that can be Used over various bands?\\nAnswer: connecting resonant elements\\n\\nQuestion: The Brazilian federal constitution states that the power to enter into treaties is vested in the president and that such treaties must be approved by Congress (articles 84, clause VIII, and 49, clause I). In practice, this has been interpreted as meaning that the executive branch is free to negotiate and sign a treaty, but its ratification by the president is contingent upon the prior approval of Congress. Additionally, the Federal Supreme Court has ruled that, following ratification and entry into force, a treaty must be incorporated into domestic law by means of a presidential decree published in the federal register in order to be valid in Brazil and applicable by the Brazilian authorities.\\nIs there an answer to this question: In order for a treaty to be valid in Brazil, a presidential decree incorporating the treaty into domestic law must be published where in order to be valid?\\n\\nAnswer: the federal register\\n\\nQ: What is a question about this article?

Eberhardt was born in Patras, Greece, where his father was the Russian consul.  Eberhardt graduated from the Marine Cadet Corps in 1878. From 1882 to 1884, he served in the Pacific Fleet as a signals officer. In 1886, he became a flag officer and adjutant to Admiral Ivan Shestakov  and in 1891 he became a flag officer to Admiral Tyrtov commanding the Russian Pacific Squadron. In 1896 Eberhardt was moved to the Black Sea Fleet, where he was gunnery officer on the battleships Ekaterina II and Chesma. In 1898 he moved to the Far East, where he commanded the Admiral Nakhimov and took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion. During the Russo-Japanese War, Eberhardt was chief naval aide to Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, the viceroy of Manchuria. In 1905, he was captain of the battleship  Imperator Aleksandr II and in 1906 he was made captain of the Panteleimon. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1907 and Vice Admiral in 1909. Eberhardt was Russia's Chief of the Russian Naval General Staff from 1908 and Commander-in-Chief of the Black Sea Fleet from 1911. During World War I, his top achievement was setting up a naval blockade of the Zonguldak coal fields, choking the coal supply of the German-Turkish fleet. He also commanded the Russian battleship squadron during the Battle of Cape Sarych. However he  was cautious to start further offensive actions against Turkish positions in the Bosporus and was replaced by Aleksandr Kolchak in 1916. Eberhardt retired from service in 1917 and was arrested by the Cheka in 1918 but released. He died in 1919 and is buried in the Novodeviche Cemetery in Petrograd.\\nHow many years was he in the Pacific fleet?\\nA: 3\\n\\n\\nProblem: As of 2010, 46.29% (584,463) of Bronx residents aged five and older spoke Spanish language at home, while 44.02% (555,767) spoke English language, 2.48% (31,361) Languages of Africa, 0.91% (11,455) French language, 0.90% (11,355) Italian language, 0.87% (10,946) Indo-Aryan languages, 0.70% (8,836) Indo-European languages, and Chinese language was spoken at home by 0.50% (6,610) of the population over the age of five.

In 1661 Louis XIV, who was particularly hostile to the Huguenots, started assuming control of his government and began to disregard some of the provisions of the Edict. In 1681 he instituted the policy of dragonnades, to intimidate Huguenot families to convert to Roman Catholicism or emigrate. Finally, in October 1685, Louis issued the Edict of Fontainebleau, which formally revoked the Edict and made the practice of Protestantism illegal in France. The revocation of the Edict had very damaging results for France. While it did not prompt renewed religious warfare, many Protestants chose to leave France rather than convert, with most moving to Great Britain, Prussia, the Dutch Republic and Switzerland. At the dawn of the 18th century, Protestants remained in significant numbers in the remote Cévennes region of the Massif Central. This population, known as the Camisards, revolted against the government in 1702, leading to fighting that continued intermittently until 1715, after which the Camisards were largely left in peace.\\nAnswer this question: Camisards, revolted against the government on and off for how many years.\\nanswer:\"},\n",

When she was nine years old her family moved to the neighbouring town of Bruhl. She has a younger brother Michael. Graf was introduced to tennis by her father, an aspiring tennis coach, who taught his three-year-old daughter how to swing a wooden racket in the family\\'s living room.\\nIn late 1999 and early 2000, as part of her Farewell Tour, Graf played a series of exhibition matches against former rivals in New Zealand, Japan, Spain, Germany and South Africa. She played Jelena Dokic in Christchurch, New Zealand, Amanda Coetzer in Durban, South Africa, and her former rival Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Zaragoza, Spain. It was Graf and Sanchez Vicario\\'s first head-to-head meeting since 1996. In February 2000, Graf played against Kimiko Date at Nagoya Rainbow Hall in Tokyo, winning in three sets. In September 2004, Graf dispatched her former doubles partner Gabriela Sabatini in straight sets, in an exhibition match played in Berlin, Germany. She was also in Berlin to host a charity gala, as well as inaugurating a tennis stadium renamed the \"Steffi Graf Stadion\". Proceeds from her match against Sabatini went to Graf\\'s foundation, \"Children for Tomorrow\".  In July 2005, Graf competed in one tie of World Team Tennis (WTT) on the Houston Wranglers team. She was beaten in two out of three matches, with each match being one set. Graf lost her singles match to Elena Likhovtseva 5-4. She teamed with Ansley Cargill in women\\'s doubles against Anna Kournikova and Likhovtseva but lost 5-2. She was successful, however, in the mixed doubles match. Graf completely ruled out a return to professional tennis. In October, Graf defeated Sabatini in an exhibition match in Mannheim, Germany, winning both of their sets. Like the exhibition match the previous year against Sabatini, proceeds went to \"Children for Tomorrow\".  In 2008 Graf lost an exhibition match against Kimiko Date at Ariake Colosseum in Tokyo. As part of the event, billed as \"Dream Match 2008\", she defeated Martina Navratilova in a one-set affair 8-7, with Graf winning a tiebreaker 10-5. It was the first time in 14 years Graf had played Navratilova. Graf played a singles exhibition match against Kim Clijsters and a mixed doubles exhibition alongside husband Andre Agassi against Tim Henman and Clijsters as part of a test event and celebration for the newly installed roof over Wimbledon\\'s Centre Court in 2009. She lost a lengthy one-set singles match to Clijsters and also the mixed doubles.  In 2010, Graf participated in the WTT Smash Hits exhibition in Washington, D.C. to support the Elton John AIDS Foundation. She and Agassi, her husband, were on Team Elton John, which competed against Team Billie Jean King. Graf played in the celebrity doubles, women\\'s doubles, and mixed doubles before straining her left calf muscle and being replaced by Anna Kournikova.\\nAnswer this question using a quote from the text above:\\n\\nWhat was the first post career match?\\n\\nAnswer:\\nexhibition matches against former rivals in New Zealand, Japan, Spain, Germany and South Africa.\\n\\n\\nQuestion:\\nParker was born in Bruges, Belgium, and raised in France. His father, Tony Parker Sr., an African American, played basketball at Loyola University Chicago as well as professionally overseas. His mother, Pamela Firestone, is a Dutch model. Parker\\'s great-uncle Jan Wienese is an Olympic gold medalist in rowing.\\nOn August 1, 2014, Parker signed a three-year, $43.3 million contract extension with the Spurs. The Spurs finished the 2014-15 season with a 55-27 record, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games. Parker struggled in the playoffs due to injury and averaged 10.9 points a game on 36% shooting.  In the 2015-16 season, Parker helped the Spurs win a franchise-best 67 games while averaging 11.9 points per game. In the 2016 playoffs, the Spurs swept the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round, but were eliminated in the second round by the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games.  Heading into the 2016-17 season, Parker lost longtime teammate Tim Duncan to retirement. The Spurs finished the season with a 61-21 record, as they registered back-to-back 60-win seasons for the first time in franchise history. Parker played 63 games and averaged 10.1 points per game, his lowest average since his rookie season. In the 2017 playoffs, the Spurs were once again matched with the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round. San Antonio again defeated Memphis 4-2, with Parker averaging 16.3 points per game in the series. After scoring 18 points in Game 2 of the second round, a win against the Houston Rockets, Parker left the game with a rupture of his left quadriceps tendon that ended his season. Game 3 of the series marked San Antonio\\'s first postseason game without Parker since 2001, which ended an NBA record of 221 straight playoff appearances for Parker. The injury required surgery and led some to speculate Parker could miss significant time, if he came back at all.  On November 27, 2017, in a 115-108 win over the Dallas Mavericks, Parker had six points and four assists in 14 minutes in his first appearance since tearing his quadriceps tendon. On November 29, Parker had 10 points and five assists while playing 18 minutes in his second game back.\\nAnswer this question using a quote from the text above:\\n\\nDid he ever get a fifth championship?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n'},\n",

That\\'s one thing we\\'re very excited about.

They are also still in this season\\'s Champions League and will face Spanish side Valencia in the last 16.\\nThe Paris club are currently top of Ligue 1 and already have a squad that includes Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva, Lucas Moura and Ezequiel Lavezzi.\\n\"I was lucky to work with Carlo and Leonardo [director of football] for a few months,\" Beckham said. \"Carlo was one of the best managers I\\'ve played for so it\\'s exciting on a number of levels.\\n\"[Ibrahimovic] is one of the players I\\'m excited to play alongside.

I will see how I feel but I want to play as long as possible. My passion is football. It always has been.

I tried two interesting options: chicken pesto pizza and baked potato pizza.  Enjoyed both a lot.\\n\\n\\nQ: negative\\n\\nA: I truly do not like to write negative reviews, so avoid them. But in this case, there is no escape.  My husband\\'s favorite food is Mexican, and he could not even finish his order.  I opted for two stars; he said to give Jims Burros half a star, so we compromised.  To begin with, we were given a minimal amount of chips, about half a typical bowl.  Refills on soda cost 50-cents to $1.00, depending on the size of drink you ordered.  I got a chicken and mole burro, hubby had a red chili one.  Both arrived wrapped in a white flour tortilla on a white plate.  Nothing else -- nor garnish, no sauce. (See photo.) We found out later we could have ordered \"enchilada style\", but this was not on the lunch menu.    My husband, who is not a picky eater, could not finish his due to taste and texture.  He decided to try something else: a ground beef taco.  It came in a shell that looked like it had just been taken out of a pre-cooked, packaged box from the store.  When he picked it up to take a bite, grease streamed out the other end.\\n\\n\\nProblem: What would be an example of an positive (OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive) review?\\n\\nAnswer: So, I recently discovered this place and it suddenly became my favorite Mexican place in town. It has a weird name, so I always thought it was BBQ or something. I\\'ve been back a few times and bring friends. Amy, is usually our server, and is hilarious and takes good care of us. I liked that she knew my name after only coming there twice. Most places in Old Town, people couldn\\'t give two shits...this was a nice change.  You can sit outside on the patio,which is relaxing. My favorite things are the $7 Patron margaritas. I always get two, because, well, I\\'m a lush. The bean dip is amazing, but my favorite\\'s the short rib tacos with House Rice. I tried some of my friends\\' shrimp tamales and macaroni and they were amazing and rich. This is the one of the best kept secrets in the area. So go! Like tonight!\\n\\n\\nInput: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive.\\nGenerate a negative review for a place\\nOutput: Croissant donut, okay, but not worth $2.49 ea..

The exhibits were fairly interesting & informative and the building was very attractive, with some nice sculptures in front and in the courtyard area.  I also liked the gift shop, as I\\'m a big fan of Native American Indian jewelry and crafts.  Some of the items were very pricey, but that\\'s to be expected.\\n\\n\\nInput: OPTIONS:\\n- negative\\n- positive.\\nGenerate a negative review for a place\\nOutput:'},\n",
